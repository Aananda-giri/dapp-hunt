      "“Maps are the most condensed humanized spaces of all…They make the landscape fit indoors, make us masters of sights we can’t see and spaces we can’t cover.” — Robert Harbison, Professor of Architecture\n",

      "Cancer, which uses genetic mutations to turn our own cells into turncoats, has been described as “the enemy within.” And it remains a formidable enemy. Nearly 1.75 million new cases of cancer are diagnosed and over 600,000 succumb to the disease every year in the United States. Despite meaningful advances in treating and managing the disease, the National Cancer Institute estimates that there are over 15 million cancer survivors living today and that nearly 40 percent of Americans will be touched by it in their lifetime. The war on cancer rages on.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the more promising strategies has been the emergence of cancer immunotherapy, a form of treatment that uses the body’s own immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy (a type of engineered immune cell) has had a profound impact on treating liquid (blood) tumors — Emily Whitehead, the first child to receive this therapy, was cured from an aggressive form of leukemia and recently celebrated 10 years of being cancer-free. And there are ongoing efforts to develop these cell therapies against solid (organ) tumors as well. Beyond cell therapies, there is an expanding arsenal of novel therapeutic modalities like bispecific antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and even vaccines that are all being developed to target a broad range of cancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, because cancer cells originate from our own healthy cells, figuring out exactly how to differentially target cancer cells from healthy cells is one of the critical, overarching challenges for cancer immunotherapy — all of these therapies need to hit molecular targets that will help elicit a strong immune response against cancer cells, but must not be present on healthy cells so as not to cause collateral damage in the form of toxicity. Even if a molecular target has the potential to be clinically relevant for a cancer immunotherapy, it also needs to be present across a sufficiently large patient population to be commercially viable to develop in the first place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This incredibly complex nature of the underlying biology — the heterogeneous nature of cancer and the abundance of targets expressed across normal cell types — has resulted in a dearth of compelling novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the explosion of new therapeutic modalities, successes to date for cancer immunotherapy have been limited to a handful of well-validated molecular targets like CD19 and BCMA that are relevant in just a subset of cancers. We have powerful hammers, we just need to find more and better nails in order to deliver on the full promise and potential of cancer immunotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first in-person meeting with the founders of Cartography — CEO Kevin Parker and Stanford physician-scientists and entrepreneurs Ansu Satpathy and Howard Chang — was around an outdoor firepit in the middle of the pandemic (precautions were taken to ensure we could meet safely). We spent the evening talking about how technologies like single-cell sequencing and computational analyses would revolutionize our understanding of the cancer target landscape — and how Cartography would chart the course. In addition to Kevin, Ansu and Howard, this founding scientific team includes Max Mumbach, Caleb Lareau and Jeffrey Verboon as well as a seasoned Scientific Advisory Board headed by CAR T pioneer Carl June along with Joe Fraietta, Emma Lundberg and Angela Shen. This crew of experienced cartographers has already published extensively on their early map-making efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "By bridging the worlds of biology and computation, Cartography is building a comprehensive atlas that will reveal the impact that any given target may have not just on cancer cells, but also on normal cells throughout the body. Cartography’s modality-agnostic platform has the potential to discover novel targets for cancers we can’t currently treat and create therapeutics across a range of modalities that are specific enough to hit tumor cells, broad enough to target all cells in a patient’s tumor, and safe enough to minimize toxic side effects — in other words, it’s a nail-finding machine for cancer immunotherapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cartography is launching with $57 million to turn the process of identifying targets from what was once a game of chance into a systematic science — to deliver on its mission to build a platform that will create more precise and effective immunotherapies. a16z was thrilled to lead the company’s seed round, to participate in the recent Series A financing led by 8VC and to work with this extraordinary group of investors, including Wing VC, Catalio, Artis, Alexandria, AME Cloud Ventures, Gaingels and the Cancer Research Institute.\n",

      "Buying traditional insurance is a no-brainer if you want to protect assets of value—be it your life, your home, or your business. If you own, say, a building, chances are you’ll want to minimize your risk against fires, floods, and other tangible natural disasters. Buying cyber insurance, however, is a much more abstract concept for businesses to grasp—especially small to midsize enterprises (SMEs). However, even though data breaches, ransomware attacks, and malware infections aren’t top of mind for mom-and-pop shops, the risk of these incidents continues to grow thanks to rising cloud adoption. According to Accenture’s recent Cost of Cybercrime study, nearly half of all cyber attacks are aimed at small businesses, but only 14% of them are prepared to defend themselves. Worse still, only 1% of small and 8% of mid-sized businesses currently have cyber insurance as an additional protection layer. \n",
      "\n",
      "So what accounts for this gap in cyber coverage for SMEs? For one, many SMEs simply are not aware that cyber insurance even exists. Second, even if SMEs are aware, their broker often does not have a product to offer them, or the policies that do exist often aren’t designed for SMEs and the types of risks they face. Why? In large part it’s becoming increasingly difficult for SMEs to secure new policies (some are even seeing existing policies canceled), because cyber losses have skyrocketed over the past several years and many incumbent insurance companies and managing general agents (MGAs) have increased prices or pulled out of the market.  \n",
      "\n",
      "These issues persist because the industry cannot dynamically serve its customer’s needs. Traditionally, across insurance categories, incumbents have relied on running existing and widely available data (e.g., the make and model of a car, or the year a building was built) through well-developed models to price products. This traditional modeling does not work for underwriting cyber risk. Incumbent models can’t understand or nimbly respond to today’s rapidly evolving cyber risks. Without the speed and ability to scale that software brings, companies are finding it difficult to underwrite policies for cyber—and losing a fortune in the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "In line with the financial services businesses we invest behind, the presence of software here can create 10x advantages over existing solutions. Software can assess vulnerabilities, provide insights and recommendations, and continue to monitor the policyholder’s security posture. Without software, it is difficult to adequately understand a prospective customer’s risk profile from either an external or internal vantage point, mitigate the risk of a cyber event, or possibly even limit exposure through streamlined post-incident responses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Importantly, for this gap to be covered, cyber policies also need to be developed and sold on a localized basis. For example, the costs of a cyber event in the US differ from one in the EU because of local differences in regulatory penalties, data costs, and costs to respond to incidents. Broker distribution is also unique by country. Therefore responding to a cyber event requires local pricing data and a locally regulated insurance entity—all data that is better evaluated by dynamic software and not staid models. \n",
      "\n",
      "All of these dynamics are why we are so excited to announce our investment in Stoik, the first-to-market startup and a leader in European cyber insurance. Stoik is an MGA that offers proprietary cyber insurance products. The company has also developed software products to better understand and limit cyber risks on both an external and internal basis. They are positioned to price and distribute risk specifically with the regional reinsurance and distribution partners in Europe. \n",
      "\n",
      "We first met Jules Veyrat, a cofounder and the CEO, in 2021. Over the past year, we’ve seen him and his cofounders Alexandre Andreini, Nicolas Sayer, and Philippe Mangematin execute at an almost impossibly quick rate. They have deep ties across the French and European insurance markets and have enlisted a strong technical team across product, engineering, and sales that are deeply steeped in the problem space. Moreover, Jules and his team are honest, dedicated, and personable—traits you want to see in a team dedicated to protecting you from risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyber insurance in Europe is just getting started. There are countless software products still to be built to protect the continent from cyber attacks, and new markets to be launched. Stoik has an exhilarating road ahead, and we’re thrilled to be their partner on the journey.\n",

      "One of the greatest challenges the world faces today is how to sustainably feed our ever-growing global population without compromising the environment or human health. Compounding this challenge are rapidly rising levels of global food insecurity, persistent levels of food waste (although some companies are making a difference here), and a dangerous reduction in arable land caused by climate change. Beef, unfortunately, is one of the biggest culprits – the cattle industry is responsible for a majority of the deforestation of the Amazon as well as a top emitter of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gasses.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in this crisis lies opportunity. Meat is a trillion-dollar market opportunity if one could find a way to address the current challenges. The plant-based meat space has grown dramatically in the last decade and attracted many supporters along the way. However, these products are still lacking in many important aspects, and it’s likely conventionally grown meat will always represent a bigger market. \n",

      "Fortunately, science has advanced to the point where there is now the potential for cultivated meat – real meat grown from cells taken via biopsy from an animal. To do this, cells are isolated from tissue taken from, for example, cow muscle, and adapted or engineered so that they can continue growing. These cells are placed in bioreactors – large steel tanks with carefully controlled conditions – and once enough are cultivated, they can then be harvested and used as a food ingredient. Ultimately, the goal is to one day create products from 100% cultured meat cells. But while multiple companies have demonstrated that growing cells for ingredient usage is possible with different kinds of meat, the cost of these proofs of concept has always been astronomical. \n",
      "\n",
      "This now leaves an engineering challenge: how can cultivated meat reach price parity with conventional meat – or (ideally) even be less costly? The most powerful approach to solving this conundrum would be to borrow from other areas of engineering and construct a design/build/test/learn platform that enables continuous improvements, and over a period of time, engineer a solution that can scale at a low cost. This is precisely what the SCiFi Foods team has done, and why I was excited to invest in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "SCiFi Foods has been able to make rapid and significant progress in the space by adapting cutting-edge synbio strategies to develop a high-throughput mammalian cell line engineering platform. Using tools like CRISPR-Cas9 and liquid handling robots enables them to run multifunctional engineering cycles while also making continuous improvements in their cell lines. SCiFi Foods is using the less costly beef cells it can create to make products that combine plant-based and cultivated meat, which could solve two major challenges in these respective spaces: a lack of optimal taste in plant-based products and the difficulty of creating 3D muscle and tissue structures from 100% cultivated meat cells at scale. In dozens of taste tests of burgers made with both plant-based and cultivated meat, people have consistently expressed amazement at how a small percentage of beef cells can create food that tastes much more like real meat than anything that’s purely plant-based. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I met Joshua March, co-founder & CEO of SCiFi Foods, he told me “I love burgers, but I want us to be able to eat them without destroying the planet,” and this really resonated: I love burgers too, but am eager for a more sustainable alternative that still tastes great. Josh was inspired to build this future after reading about the concept of growing meat outside the animal in a sci-fi book fifteen years ago. To make it reality, he teamed up with Kasia Gora, PhD, an accomplished scientist with a decade of experience in industrial bioengineering. They have built an incredibly strong team that is making rapid progress toward not only bringing cultivated meat to market, but redefining the way people believe it must be created. \n",
      "\n",
      "Josh and Kasia are a dynamic duo combining their experience in technology and biotech startups to disrupt one of the biggest markets in the world, and in doing so, curb the consequences of climate change. I’m honored to support them and the team as an investor and board member, and look forward to helping SCiFi Foods become one of the defining brands of our generation.\n",

      "\n",
      " content:\n",
      "Many of the most popular, genre-defining games trace their heritage to what are called “mods”—player-made modifications to existing games. The mods are built from developer tools within the game so that players can create new levels, maps, and even new game mechanics. Take Warcraft 3, for example, which sold millions of copies and encouraged players to create mods with tools shipped inside the game. Famously, one of the mods was called Defense of the Ancients which facilitated powerful sets of heroes to battle each other in the first version of what became the popular MOBA genre—the genre that later spawned the groundbreaking League of Legends. And this isn’t the only example of mods supercharging the gameplay experience and player communities. The widely played shooter, PUBG, was derived from Arma and Counter-Strike was originally a mod of Half Life. The list goes on.\n",
      "\n",
      "The liberating and powerful forces behind modding are two-fold: user-generated content (UGC) and extensibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mods embody both of these features—UGC by giving devs the tools and platform to freely create; extensibility by turning what was once a siloed, rigid world into a scaffold that can be built upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s because we believe in mods that it is with great pleasure that we are announcing our Series A investment into Omni Creator Products (OCP). OCP is building simple, yet powerful creation tools to facilitate modding, as well as the scaffold through a game codenamed Muse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Muse takes inspiration from some of the industry’s most successful titles. They plan to make a highly social, highly replayable game with lots of variety. It is intentionally designed to be a great scaffold for people to remix and create from.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alongside their game, OCP is building ‘Creator Lab’ where players can remix Muse or games created by other UGC creators. Muse will be the scaffold for creation, but from there, anything can happen. Creator Lab will be simple enough to let anyone build a basic world, but also enable complex mechanics that invite mods to change the game entirely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cofounders Mike and Nick Atamas are truly spectacular. The two brothers hail from Epic, where they were advertised as beacons of success to new hires. Mike was originally in legal leading Unreal Engine licensing and global privacy, but would often weigh in on Epic’s most important strategy decisions. After the leadership team took notice, Mike transitioned to Senior Director of Strategy and Operations. Nick was one of the best engineers at Epic, working on many of the company’s key projects and was eventually given special projects from Tim Sweeney to pursue individually. The two have also recruited one of the strongest teams, mixing the best out of Epic–like Fortnite Creative’s former dev relations lead, Deepak Nair–with veterans from leading companies across the games industry. The two brothers are similarly hard working, passionate, and intelligent, but differ in their demeanors. As a whole, they augment each other’s greatest strengths and are a perfect duo for this ambitious endeavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we look to the future, we are excited to see how the right modding systems can turn siloed games into platforms, and how the next generation of indie developers can leverage the work of developers before them. We believe the OCP team is leading the charge here, and we’re ecstatic to support them on the next phase of their journey!\n",

Nash customers get access to a network of hundreds of local and national providers and immediately receive quotes for delivery requests based on price, availability, and vehicle type. Businesses can use Nash to activate same-day (or even same-hour) delivery for their customers.\u00a0", "We first partnered with Nash for their seed round in the fall of 2021, shortly after co-founders Mahmoud Ghulman and Aziz Alghunaim launched the company and graduated from YCombinator. At that time, Nash was primarily serving local businesses \u2014 many of whom had been hit hard by the pandemic and wanted to compete with Amazon and other mega-retailers\u00a0 by also offering delivery.\u00a0", "Since then, Nash has seen what we feel is extraordinary growth in their customer base and revenue. The platform is still a key partner to many SMBs, but it has also become a critical part of the logistics infrastructure for many larger enterprise and consumer companies \u2014 even marketplaces. Businesses use Nash to deliver everything from hot meals to auto parts to dry cleaning.\u00a0", "The Nash platform is built for flexibility. As a business, you can use Nash to run on-demand, scheduled, or even multi-drop off routes. If you already have a fleet in some or all of your markets, you can add these drivers to Nash. The platform will optimize between internal and third-party drivers, saving valuable ops team time.\u00a0", "Another core Nash value prop is reliability. If you\u2019ve ever waited on a late or missing delivery, you know this is an incredibly frustrating customer experience. The Nash platform tracks and notifies businesses of any delays, and if there\u2019s a delivery interruption, Nash will automatically reroute the job to another provider who can get it done.\u00a0", "Co-founders Mahmoud and Aziz have been working on projects together for a decade. They first met on the high school science fair circuit, and both studied at MIT. Mahmoud previously founded an on-demand gig-worker startup, while Aziz founded a (YC-backed) nonprofit to connect refugees with translators. They both have a passion for helping other business owners \u201clevel up\u201d the services they can provide to consumers.\u00a0", "The Nash network is live in all 50 states and Canada, and covers more than 94% of the U.S. population.

CAR T-cell therapy (a type of engineered immune cell) has had a profound impact on treating liquid (blood) tumors \u2014 Emily Whitehead, the first child to receive this therapy, was cured from an aggressive form of leukemia and recently celebrated 10 years of being cancer-free. And there are ongoing efforts to develop these cell therapies against solid (organ) tumors as well. Beyond cell therapies, there is an expanding arsenal of novel therapeutic modalities like bispecific antibodies, immune checkpoint inhibitors and even vaccines that are all being developed to target a broad range of cancers.", "But, because cancer cells originate from our own healthy cells, figuring out exactly how to differentially target cancer cells from healthy cells is one of the critical, overarching challenges for cancer immunotherapy \u2014 all of these therapies need to hit molecular targets that will help elicit a strong immune response against cancer cells, but must not be present on healthy cells so as not to cause collateral damage in the form of toxicity. Even if a molecular target has the potential to be clinically relevant for a cancer immunotherapy, it also needs to be present across a sufficiently large patient population to be commercially viable to develop in the first place.", "This incredibly complex nature of the underlying biology \u2014 the heterogeneous nature of cancer and the abundance of targets expressed across normal cell types \u2014 has resulted in a dearth of compelling novel targets for cancer immunotherapy. Despite the explosion of new therapeutic modalities, successes to date for cancer immunotherapy have been limited to a handful of well-validated molecular targets like CD19 and BCMA that are relevant in just a subset of cancers.

If you own, say, a building, chances are you\u2019ll want to minimize your risk against fires, floods, and other tangible natural disasters. Buying cyber insurance, however, is a much more abstract concept for businesses to grasp\u2014especially small to midsize enterprises (SMEs). However, even though data breaches, ransomware attacks, and malware infections aren\u2019t top of mind for mom-and-pop shops, the risk of these incidents continues to grow thanks to rising cloud adoption. According to Accenture\u2019s recent Cost of Cybercrime study, nearly half of all cyber attacks are aimed at small businesses, but only 14% of them are prepared to defend themselves. Worse still, only 1% of small and 8% of mid-sized businesses currently have cyber insurance as an additional protection layer.\u00a0", "So what accounts for this gap in cyber coverage for SMEs? For one, many SMEs simply are not aware that cyber insurance even exists. Second, even if SMEs are aware, their broker often does not have a product to offer them, or the policies that do exist often aren\u2019t designed for SMEs and the types of risks they face. Why? In large part it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult for SMEs to secure new policies (some are even seeing existing policies canceled), because cyber losses have skyrocketed over the past several years and many incumbent insurance companies and managing general agents (MGAs) have increased prices or pulled out of the market.\u00a0\u00a0", "These issues persist because the industry cannot dynamically serve its customer\u2019s needs. Traditionally, across insurance categories, incumbents have relied on running existing and widely available data (e.g., the make and model of a car, or the year a building was built) through well-developed models to price products. This traditional modeling does not work for underwriting cyber risk. Incumbent models can\u2019t understand or nimbly respond to today\u2019s rapidly evolving cyber risks. Without the speed and ability to scale that software brings, companies are finding it difficult to underwrite policies for cyber\u2014and losing a fortune in the process.", "In line with the financial services businesses we invest behind, the presence of software here can create 10x advantages over existing solutions. Software can assess vulnerabilities, provide insights and recommendations, and continue to monitor the policyholder\u2019s security posture. Without software, it is difficult to adequately understand a prospective customer\u2019s risk profile from either an external or internal vantage point, mitigate the risk of a cyber event, or possibly even limit exposure through streamlined post-incident responses.\u00a0", "Importantly, for this gap to be covered, cyber policies also need to be developed and sold on a localized basis. For example, the costs of a cyber event in the US differ from one in the EU because of local differences in regulatory penalties, data costs, and costs to respond to incidents. Broker distribution is also unique by country. Therefore responding to a cyber event requires local pricing data and a locally regulated insurance entity\u2014all data that is better evaluated by dynamic software and not staid models.\u00a0", "All of these dynamics are why we are so excited to announce our investment in Stoik, the first-to-market startup and a leader in European cyber insurance. Stoik is an MGA that offers proprietary cyber insurance products. The company has also developed software products to better understand and limit cyber risks on both an external and internal basis. They are positioned to price and distribute risk specifically with the regional reinsurance and distribution partners in Europe.\u00a0", "We first met Jules Veyrat, a cofounder and the CEO, in 2021. Over the past year, we\u2019ve seen him and his cofounders Alexandre Andreini, Nicolas Sayer, and Philippe Mangematin execute at an almost impossibly quick rate.

Compounding this challenge are rapidly rising levels of global food insecurity, persistent levels of food waste (although some companies are making a difference here), and a dangerous reduction in arable land caused by climate change. Beef, unfortunately, is one of the biggest culprits \u2013 the cattle industry is responsible for a majority of the deforestation of the Amazon as well as a top emitter of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gasses.", "But in this crisis lies opportunity. Meat is a trillion-dollar market opportunity if one could find a way to address the current challenges. The plant-based meat space has grown dramatically in the last decade and attracted many supporters along the way. However, these products are still lacking in many important aspects, and it\u2019s likely conventionally grown meat will always represent a bigger market.\u00a0", "Fortunately, science has advanced to the point where there is now the potential for cultivated meat \u2013 real meat grown from cells taken via biopsy from an animal. To do this, cells are isolated from tissue taken from, for example, cow muscle, and adapted or engineered so that they can continue growing. These cells are placed in bioreactors \u2013 large steel tanks with carefully controlled conditions \u2013 and once enough are cultivated, they can then be harvested and used as a food ingredient. Ultimately, the goal is to one day create products from 100% cultured meat cells. But while multiple companies have demonstrated that growing cells for ingredient usage is possible with different kinds of meat, the cost of these proofs of concept has always been astronomical.\u00a0", "This now leaves an engineering challenge: how can cultivated meat reach price parity with conventional meat \u2013 or (ideally) even be less costly? The most powerful approach to solving this conundrum would be to borrow from other areas of engineering and construct a design/build/test/learn platform that enables continuous improvements, and over a period of time, engineer a solution that can scale at a low cost. This is precisely what the SCiFi Foods team has done, and why I was excited to invest in them.", "SCiFi Foods has been able to make rapid and significant progress in the space by adapting cutting-edge synbio strategies to develop a high-throughput mammalian cell line engineering platform. Using tools like CRISPR-Cas9 and liquid handling robots enables them to run multifunctional engineering cycles while also making continuous improvements in their cell lines. SCiFi Foods is using the less costly beef cells it can create to make products that combine plant-based and cultivated meat, which could solve two major challenges in these respective spaces: a lack of optimal taste in plant-based products and the difficulty of creating 3D muscle and tissue structures from 100% cultivated meat cells at scale. In dozens of taste tests of burgers made with both plant-based and cultivated meat, people have consistently expressed amazement at how a small percentage of beef cells can create food that tastes much more like real meat than anything that\u2019s purely plant-based.\u00a0", "When I met Joshua March, co-founder & CEO of SCiFi Foods, he told me \u201cI love burgers, but I want us to be able to eat them without destroying the planet,\u201d and this really resonated: I love burgers too, but am eager for a more sustainable alternative that still tastes great. Josh was inspired to build this future after reading about the concept of growing meat outside the animal in a sci-fi book fifteen years ago. To make it reality, he teamed up with Kasia Gora, PhD, an accomplished scientist with a decade of experience in industrial bioengineering. They have built an incredibly strong team that is making rapid progress toward not only bringing cultivated meat to market, but redefining the way people believe it must be created.\u00a0", "Josh and Kasia are a dynamic duo combining their experience in technology and biotech startups to disrupt one of the biggest markets in the world, and in doing so, curb the consequences of climate change.

The defense industrial base is served by a network of thousands of small machine shops across the country, often run by very talented machinists who have spent a lifetime honing their craft. The average age of a lead machinist in America is now hovering around the mid 50s, and like other skilled trades, the coming retirement of the Boomers is leading to a dangerous labor shortage in an important industry.

All of this allows fintechs to abstract away the complexities of acting like a bank, and instead focus on their core value proposition of innovating on the customer experience. Collectively, Cross River serves millions of consumers and businesses globally, including some of the fastest growing and largest fintech platforms like Affirm, Stripe, Upgrade, and Upstart.

Patients with chronic disease have (often predictable) symptoms and questions every single day \u2013 so why does our healthcare system address them only sporadically?", "Manav and Kunaal are scrappy technologists, and quickly built an early version of Memora\u2019s initial product: a smart communication engine that could continuously remind patients about the medications that they were prescribed, collect patient-reported data, and triage concerns to a care team. Eager to better understand the needs and implementation challenges of their end users and customers, they then went on the road for 6 months, staying at Airbnbs across the country, to speak with clinicians and leaders at one health system after another. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, they learned that health systems were eager to provide more continuous care outside their four walls, that standardizing evidence-based care delivery remained a frequent challenge, and that the solutions being built by existing technology vendors were cumbersome, and unlikely to leverage cutting-edge machine learning (ML) and natural language processing techniques to be learning from patient data on an ongoing basis.", "Then, the pandemic arrived. What were previously stretch goals for health systems with respect to remote patient interaction and provider enablement \u2013 suddenly became requirements.

Most touted high-touch patient engagement as key differentiators of their care models, but few offered true evidence-based care journeys that could be trained on years of historical care data (most of which is institutionalized within large health systems).

On top of this, they seamlessly integrate into the merchant\u2019s site to keep the customer apprised of their order progress as soon as something changes.", "Flexport also helps solve a chronic problem that arises before a ship leaves a port: underfilled containers. We were shocked to learn that before the supply chain crisis containers were only 70% full on average when shipped across the ocean! This means higher costs for shippers and less throughput in a supply-constrained system.

Securing inventory for retailers also often requires a high minimums, upfront cash payment or deposit, when working capital loans are limited and expensive in Brazil. Most stores don\u2019t have a corporate credit card, so their typical options for financing are paying upfront which is very risky, or getting a loan.

Programmable blockchains are interesting for the same reason that innovation on smartphones spiked after opening up development to third parties via app stores. We are now seeing waves of brilliant, creative people building new products and services on top of blockchains that are disrupting industries and reaching mainstream adoption. DeFi was the first wave of blockchain killer apps that broke out about a year ago, followed by NFTs and crypto gaming experiences this year. What comes next is hard to predict, but DAOs (decentralized autonomous organizations) are likely to have an enormous impact on the adoption of web3 products.\u00a0", "DAOs are internet-native, global collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals. To appreciate what is so powerful about this new method of organizing communities and aligning incentives to funnel creative energy, let\u2019s look at history. Venice is known as a focal point of the Italian Renaissance, but almost none of the most groundbreaking inventions of the age originated there. Double-entry bookkeeping was imported from the Levant. The Arabic numerals that made it possible were originally from India. The industrial advances used to run the whole operation came from China.\u00a0", "What Venice did have\u2014and became renowned for\u2014was a radically elevated merchant class with ownership and representation in government, which enabled them to assemble the best of the world\u2019s resources. New ideas, concepts, and inventions could be combined, organized, scaled, and sometimes even reinvented in Venice. The result was explosive: in the 13th century, Venice became the richest and most powerful city in Europe, and despite dozens of regime changes (amazingly, the heads of state were called \u201cDoges\u201d), it was able to hold this title for hundreds of years.\u00a0", "In addition to borderless resource assembly, DAOs also enable bottom-up innovation and community building, from which new ideas can be incubated and scaled. A more recent historical comparison is the Homebrew Computer Club, a Silicon Valley forum for sharing ideas where Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak debuted the first Apple computer in 1976. Truly disruptive innovations often look like toys at the outset, and emerge when groups of smart people get together and collaborate on hobbies they\u2019re passionate about.", "What we\u2019re seeing in web3 feels familiar in many ways. Today, artists are using NFTs to capture the full value of their work. Talented engineers with only an internet connection are contributing to the most important blockchain infrastructure, regardless of their age, gender, or pedigree. Like Venice did for early modern Europe, web3 is redefining how global talent pools their knowledge and work together. And like the Homebrew Computer Club in the 1970s, communities of smart, passionate, \u201chobbyists\u201d are gathering in forums to tinker with a new set of primitives to build groundbreaking products and experiences. Those communities are being organized today via DAOs, the web3 group coordination primitive.\u00a0", "Until recently, DAOs were used mostly to secure DeFi protocols, and DAO members consisted primarily of highly technical contributors. FWB (Friends With Benefits) represents a new kind of DAO. Founded initially as a token-gated Discord server, FWB has become the de facto home of web3\u2019s growing creative class. Joining FWB requires a written application, which the community itself reviews and votes on, as well as a minimum buy-in of $FWB tokens, which represent meaningful ownership in the DAO. In addition to capturing the upside of the DAO\u2019s creative output, the tokens come with governing power over a community treasury. By aligning the incentives of the next generation of artists, creators, and builders, FWB is enabling a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of the internet. Fittingly, they describe themselves as a digital city.", "We have long believed the creative class is among the most under-monetized talent pools in web2, driving the vast majority of the cultural value and capturing little of it in return. The average American consumer spends a third of their waking hours streaming music, and yet only 1% of music artists are able to make a living through streaming. Crypto offers a dramatically more incentive-aligned way for creatives to monetize their passions, but we also recognize that the adoption hurdles have remained significant. FWB serves as the port city of web3, introducing a culturally influential class to crypto by putting human capital first.\u00a0", "Since its humble beginnings as a social experiment in September 2020, FWB has grown to nearly 2000 members and its community has driven an outsized portion of the cultural value in web3. DAO members have launched a (now canonical) token-gated events app, an NFT gallery, a web3-focused editorial venture, a virtual music studio, and a real-time community dashboard, in addition to a series of parties around the world. Their next venture, FWB Cities, aims to scale the DAO\u2019s IRL footprint, partnering with city-specific spaces, communities, and experiences to bring real world benefits to the FWB membership. In this way, FWB Cities offers a glimpse into the very first IRL metaverse and will make the entry fee even more accessible to more people.", "Because of FWB, it\u2019s now possible to envision a world where the first time you interact with crypto is when you walk into a bar or attend your friend\u2019s concert. Our goal is to offer guidance as FWB navigates the complexities that come with the next phase of DAO maturity. We plan to actively participate in governance and we will empower key community members through delegation.

They\u2019ve built an immense product surface area to make ClickUp the place to get work done on any collaboration form factor, empowering task management, chat / email messaging, documents, spreadsheets, goal-setting, and undoubtedly more to come. Outside of the first-adopter crowd exploring any new product that comes out, user fatigue is intensifying with every new productivity app fighting for attention. And ironically, each new promise to make collaboration smoother often just creates another data silo within an employee base, making working together even more disjointed. ClickUp is building a modern bundle of productivity and collaboration applications, all delivered in a single, unified platform, which puts them in the crosshairs of literally hundreds of competitors. Now that takes courage! What we hadn\u2019t yet realized years ago was that ClickUp had the only thing that mattered \u2013 the winning strategy to break out from the pack.", "Over the last few years, Zeb and the rest of the team at ClickUp have executed one of the most aggressive playbooks we\u2019ve ever seen. The secret behind their success begins with a relentless commitment to shipping at a weekly cadence, launching new improvements every Friday for years without fail (other than a few holidays!).

From there, the go-to-market engine took off, racing to more than 800,000 teams in just four years since. One other key element to their success is an obsession with the end user. This is evident in how swiftly they incorporate user feedback into the product and 24/7 customer support that\u2019s managed entirely internally by the ClickUp team. And that level of support is not just for their biggest accounts, but for any customer\u2026 increasingly rare in this era of enterprise software!", "After spending time with Zeb, it\u2019s become abundantly clear to us that each of the ingredients behind ClickUp\u2019s success is a direct expression of Zeb\u2019s drive and determination: from his growth mindset, committed to incessantly pushing forward, to a customer satisfaction obsession that dates back to a thankless job Zeb worked at Disney World driving a monorail tram full of picky tourists. That paired with Zeb\u2019s knack for surrounding himself with driven, creative partners underscores our excitement in this company.", "In the last year, ClickUp has tripled its revenue and grew its customer base by 2.5x.

Even before the pandemic, it was on its heels in the face of a fee-for-service reimbursement system biased towards technically complex specialty care and increasing financial pressure from new competition like urgent care and telemedicine clinics. COVID-19 further exacerbated the pain by nearly wiping out visit volumes for routine, non-emergency services, and creating major access issues for the most vulnerable patient populations.", "As the healthcare system reemerges from the storm and sees visit volumes recover, we observe a few things:\u00a0", "At the intersection of these trends, a first wave of advanced primary care companies has shown over the last decade that high-quality care can be delivered at lower cost to populations of medically complex seniors, and that those models can be scaled nationwide. These companies take one of three forms: a primary care provider with a traditional brick-and-mortar presence; an \u201cMSO\u201d (management services organization) that helps existing providers manage risk contracts; or an insurance company that may have vertically integrated clinical assets. Telehealth and home health services were layered on top of these models in response to the pandemic, but even so, these approaches were predicated on the ability to serve patients within a given catchment area of a physical clinic location. Many of these clinics also serve a range of patients, from pediatric to adult to geriatric, and take a mix of fee-for-service and capitated payments.", "With this backdrop, in the same way that digital-native businesses like Airbnb exhibit fundamentally different first-principles thinking about their operating models relative to their traditional, brick-and-mortar-based peers, Patina saw the need for a new, purpose-built approach, with a singular focus on older adults (65+). They\u2019re building a virtual-first care model absent the constraints of physical assets, with a value-based business model that rewards investment in patient engagement, tech to scale integrated care teams, navigation to ensure optimal utilization of benefits, and whole person health for all of its patients.

This is an all too familiar motion to analysts, sales reps, customer success managers, and more, preparing data-rich presentations for business reviews, product feature roadmaps, and beyond. This painstaking process of tracking down relevant data and visualizing it in a presentation probably sounds familiar to most working professionals because presentations are an effective and influential means of storytelling for a business. So many of us strive to personalize presentations for the most impact, but the process is often incredibly manual and bespoke.\u00a0", "Design, visuals, and storyline aside, we also know how important data is in creating a narrative, and presentations can impact company decisions. One prominent use case for data-driven presentations is the quarterly business review, or \u201cQBR\u201d, which is very popularly used between customer success managers (CSMs) and customers. These presentations require real-time updates to customer and product data in order to have productive conversations around how much more value could be delivered in the future, teeing up revenue generating conversations around up-sell and cross-sell opportunities. Instead of focusing on customer conversations, CSMs bear the time-intensive and manual responsibility of personalizing all of these presentations. One CSM described the process as a \u201cpiecemeal nightmare\u201d that often takes up to four hours to prepare for a single customer. Considering that it\u2019s fairly typical for a CSM to have >100 accounts, all of whom need a quarterly touchpoint, that comes out to compiling greater than ten presentations each week, shifting their focus from strategic initiatives to spreadsheets.\u00a0", "There is perhaps no one who appreciates this problem more than the cofounders of Matik, Nik and Zak. In his prior job at LinkedIn, Nik worked on an internal solution to facilitate this presentation-building process for the company\u2019s go-to-market teams, and led the eventual redesign of the solution. But knowing how universal this problem was, he was always itching to build a company to solve it. Thus, Matik was born. Matik\u2019s product hosts customer presentation templates and connects to a variety of data sources \u2013 including data warehouses, CRMs, and BI tools \u2013 so the content can be personalized and dynamic. Unlike many other next-gen presentation software, Matik is tailored for existing GSuite and Microsoft users without requiring them to switch platforms. It automatically generates personalized presentations in a matter of minutes, and this is done natively in PowerPoint or Google Slides so that the user can still edit the presentations to their preference. No matter how many times we see the product demo, the magical feeling it evokes never ceases to bring a smile to our faces (while also causing all of us to wish we could have used Matik in prior jobs).\u00a0\u00a0", "Every customer we spoke to during our diligence process raved about the product and how much time it saves them, allowing their CSMs to spend more time on strategic work. The magnitude of Matik\u2019s impact can\u2019t be understated: numerous customers told us how the time savings went as far as changing how their companies thought about building out their organizations, because Matik fundamentally changed the math around headcount planning. For example, one startup customer who walked us through their ROI thinking said Matik saved their customer success team 40 hours a week, and additionally saved the data science team 40 hours per quarter. They said \u201cif Matik didn\u2019t exist, my only other option would be to hire a FTE to do this manually.\u201d", "And the QBR use case is only one example of where Matik can make a significant difference. In a world where customers are increasingly trying products before buying them, sales conversations need to reflect the data from pre-sales interactions and customers have come to expect personalized presentations. Many of Matik\u2019s customers who initially adopted the product for their CSMs have expanded their deployments to their sales teams. Still, data-powered presentations are just the beginning for Matik. There are so many forms of static documents that can be enhanced by making the data dynamic, like financial reports, marketing and product materials, board decks, and even emails. The premise of automating insights is ubiquitous and Matik should be the go-to solution for automatically generating any document that is data-driven in nature and used for storytelling \u2013 and that\u2019s a lot of documents!", "Nik and Zak are deeply thoughtful while also being extremely ambitious about bringing this vision to life. They\u2019ve surrounded themselves with a driven team who are just as passionate about helping deliver for their customers.

At a more basic level, the ability to offer convenient, home-based services also confers a competitive advantage to providers vying for patient loyalty, especially given new consumer norms and preferences that arose as a consequence of the pandemic. Given the choice of taking an hour out of your day to schlep to a patient services center where hundreds of other, potentially sick, patients have been, or scheduling a 5-minute phlebotomist visit in your home or office, which would you choose?", "This mode of \u201cuntethered healthcare\u201d is one of the release valves that has sprung open in response to the severe patient satisfaction and supply-demand mismatch pressures ailing our traditional healthcare system. We\u2019ve historically been constrained by the opaque schedules of physicians and nurses in centralized, monolithic facilities, resulting in weeks- or months-long wait times for even the most basic, low-acuity services. Rather than try to create and hire more physicians and nurses, or squeeze more appointments into their already exhausted schedules, digital health companies are lighting up under-leveraged clinical labor pools (e.g. EMTs, pharmacists, health coaches, phlebotomists), making them a core part of their care teams and applying tech to extend their reach into distributed settings, on patients\u2019 terms.\u00a0", "This is all happening at a time when the value of on-demand diagnostic testing and continuous monitoring are in the spotlight. While the majority of healthcare decisions are already influenced by lab tests and biomarker monitoring, there are many areas in which we severely under-utilize lab tests that would otherwise allow us to detect disease earlier, or help better manage already diagnosed conditions. It turns out there\u2019s even a non-trivial amount of drop-off from tests that are ordered but not completed\u2014research shows that in areas like type 2 diabetes management or medication monitoring programs, upwards of 1 in 4 of lab tests orders go unfulfilled, perhaps in large part due to the inconvenience factor for the patient. Biotech and pharma clinical research is another area where decentralized testing and monitoring capabilities have the potential to significantly enhance the productivity and diversity of clinical trials.", "Thus, at the intersection of the new tech stack for virtual-first care and the establishment of the home as a primary site of care lies a fast-growing market opportunity for on-demand, last-mile care delivery capabilities. Sprinter Health is leading the charge in this domain, with a platform that deploys a fleet of mobile clinical professionals and instruments the distributed logistics and care team operations, flipping the supply-demand equation and letting care come to the patient, versus forcing patients to come to the care. Their equivalents of the \u201cdriver app\u201d for providers and \u201crider app\u201d for patients enable the type of real-time visibility, feedback, and course correction that is entirely absent from traditional healthcare experiences. And the ability to standardize sample collection, patient data intake, and clinical data analysis across multiple providers through their workflow automation and data platform also represents profound possibilities for interoperability, scalability, and network effects in the long run.\u00a0", "We gravitate towards founders who have seen what great looks like, and who know what it takes to lean into new category creation opportunities that come along with such rarity in any given industry\u2019s lifetime.

Traditionally, it is the step in software development that takes the files written by engineers and compiles them into machine runnable code, but build has become so much more. Yes, it is used to compile code, but it is often the start of the developer workflow, from orchestrating application tooling, testing, environment setup, security, and compliance testing to even deployment. It really has become the central nervous system to development.\u00a0", "At a16z, we\u2019ve been tracking build systems closely for years because it plays such a key role in software. However, build tools have been a fragmented market, with a particular build system most commonly used with a given language. For example, Java developers were likely to use a different tool than, say, C developers.\u00a0", "All of this changed when Google open sourced Bazel, which has since become a leading build system industry-wide. Bazel is an incredibly powerful build system that is fast, multi-language, extensible, and tremendously powerful. Over the last few years we\u2019ve seen it take off rapidly in the industry, with adoption by many of the most sophisticated software companies.\u00a0", "Therefore, we were overjoyed when we learned that two of the core Bazel team, Helen Altshuler and Ulf Adams, had left to found EngFlow, the Bazel company. Early into our first meeting, we were fully sold on the team. Ulf, who is CTO, is one of the creators of Bazel and also one of the most respected engineers we\u2019ve ever spoken to. And Helen, who is CEO, has an incredibly impressive background as a tech leader and has been integral to the Bazel community, where she led the adoption of the open source project and has deep relationships with everyone involved and on the periphery. Beyond that, they\u2019ve put together the highest density of build and Bazel experts we\u2019ve ever seen, with 70 percent of the company being from the original Bazel team and open source contributors.\u00a0", "We\u2019re very excited to announce that we\u2019ve joined the EngFlow team and led their seed round. Helen and Ulf are exactly the type of founders we love to back, and EngFlow \u2014 which is based on a leading, open, and deeply technical project and is delivering Bazel solutions to the enterprise \u2014 is exactly the type of company we love to be involved in. Since we made the investment, I\u2019ve had the pleasure of watching the company\u2019s development over the last few months, and EngFlow is already engaged with many top software companies as paying customers, including Snap and Brave. It\u2019s almost as if this seedling was birthed as a full adult!\u00a0", "EngFlow\u2019s solution is not limited to Bazel.

And while patient care is immensely rewarding, I also know that the patient experience could \u2014 and should \u2014 be 10X better.

An elderly Spanish-speaking gentleman whose wife has to fight the system at every step of the way to ensure that her husband can start targeted therapy for lung cancer. A middle-aged man receiving immunotherapy while newly homeless, but lacking access to basic food and transportation.

Care varies substantially by region, by provider, by plan, and by patients\u2019 socioeconomic status. The Thyme Care team (and I) know this not only because we\u2019ve witnessed it directly as providers and family members, but also because many of us had the opportunity to use data to study these phenomena while working at Flatiron Health. The data showed over and over that cancer care varies in cost, quality, and depth. Only some patients are able to access tumor genomic sequencing; only some patients are offered palliative care rather than chemotherapy near the end of their lives; the list goes on.", "It is an unacceptable reality of cancer care in this country that far too many patients cite access to care, difficulty navigating the system, and financial toxicity as some of their greatest sources of concern. Indeed, cancer patients are 2.5x more likely to declare bankruptcy than the average American. We must do better.", "So how is it, then, that we spend over $180B annually on cancer care in the U.S.? This pool of resources seems massive \u2014 but in reality, a great deal of this spend is fundamentally inefficient, and attributable to misaligned organizational incentives, data, and communication across the three principal participants in the cancer care system: patients (and their caregivers), providers, and payors.", "Perhaps the most glaring is fee-for-service reimbursement for oncology care, which reimburses providers and hospitals for individual pieces of expensive care (procedures, visits, therapies), without consideration for long-term quality, or total cost borne by the healthcare system and patient. And even though both the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and commercial payors have launched multiple regional and national value-based oncology care models over the past few years, the early data from these programs shows that a) most oncology practices aren\u2019t provided the right resources to succeed in these models, and b) most payors and providers do not have access to the data, technology, or resources required to actually change how and where cancer patients receive care.", "How does this play out in practice? Let\u2019s take, for example, a common scenario: a cancer patient on therapy experiences increasing nausea and vomiting, making it difficult for her to eat on a Saturday. In the status quo, she is likely to present to an emergency department and be admitted to the hospital, even though the actual interventions undertaken in the hospital (e.g., prescription of an anti-nausea medication) might have been readily handled in the outpatient setting, at dramatically lower cost, higher patient convenience, and often a more favorable outcome. Why? Because nobody is truly incentivized to prevent this. The outpatient oncology care team has not been incentivized to build after-hours care capacity. The emergency department does not have access to enough data about the patient\u2019s cancer care, so admits her out of precaution. And even when she is discharged from the hospital, care coordination relies on provider trust and goodwill rather than organizational structure. The key problem at the center of this story is that nobody in the value chain is incentivized \u2014 on a continuous, longitudinal basis \u2014 to pursue proactive symptom management and site-of-service shifts that ultimately serve the patient and system best. And so we get sub-optimal outcomes even when every single physician, nurse, and care manager\u2026is doing the best they humanly can.", "There are several important tailwinds that make this a favorable moment to begin executing on a business model like Thyme\u2019s:", "The data, technology, and care management required to fundamentally rewire cancer care are now within our reach. We can make our collective dollar go much farther \u2014 but we need the data to help guide patients to high-value care from the day they first receive a cancer diagnosis, through the maze of multiple providers they will inevitably encounter along the way (including their trusted primary care provider), and ultimately to the outcomes that patients and families want for themselves. This navigation is exactly what Thyme Care offers its members \u2014 and this is also what has been fundamentally missing in prior instances of value-based oncology care.", "We could not imagine a group better suited to build this company than Thyme Care\u2019s founding team. We have known them individually for many years, via work at Flatiron Health, and have seen up-close their deep commitment to getting to the right answer on behalf of patients. CEO and co-founder Robin Shah has lived and worked in oncology for over 15 years, initially managing various aspects of his father\u2019s busy community oncology practice, then growing Flatiron Health\u2019s large network of data-aligned community oncology clinics, and most recently launching and running a new value-based community oncology network called One Oncology. In each of these settings, he felt a hunger to more dramatically and directly transform the patient experience, which led him to start Thyme Care. His team now includes one of my favorite former colleagues at Flatiron Health: Bobby Green, a kind, brilliant, and magnetic medical oncologist himself and formerly Flatiron\u2019s Chief Medical Officer.

The Manifold team worked with Pak to create a whitelist of holders of his ASH token, which then permitted the most loyal members of Pak\u2019s community to access the Lost Poets mint an hour earlier than anyone else. Using the ERC1155 standard, Manifold and Pak were also able to create a more gas-efficient means of minting multiple NFTs at once for approved collectors, consuming millions of dollars less gas in the process when compared with a standard contract.\u00a0", "The most valuable NFTs are, to put it simply, beautiful. Manifold treats the blockchain like a new kind of artistic canvas \u2014 and like any new medium, there are now new forms and ideas to play around with. The process of minting an NFT, as dramatic and competitive as it might be, is still a tiny part of the ownership experience. Provenance and creativity are what distinguishes a truly special NFT drop, and Manifold has worked thoughtfully to extend tools to artists to make their works stand out from the crowd. The Mad Dog Jones REPLICATOR auction is one such case. Manifold worked with the creator to make a custom header for the REPLICATOR NFT contract, allowing owners to refer to the code itself to ensure the work\u2019s origin. Even cooler, the REPLICATOR contract can be wrapped with any other conceivable smart contract another developer might choose to build, allowing the NFT to react in realtime to events and outcomes designated by another person. Any artist can take this capability and integrate it into their own drop, and any developer could build functions around it. You might imagine an NFT that reacts to the weather, or to on-chain history, or the contents of a person\u2019s wallet at any given moment. The possibilities are endless.The team \u2014 led by Eric Diep, Richerd Chan, and Wilkins Chung \u2014 has extensive experience in gaming, and we\u2019re impressed by their commitment to creating protocols that work for both specific NFT artists and the entire web3 community.

Value-based care promised a future in which our healthcare system (and its consumers) would systematically pay for value, rather than volume. In principle, aligning incentives to value would curb healthcare spending while simultaneously improving patient outcomes. To their great credit, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) explored numerous value-based care models and alternative payment structures over the last 10+ years, ranging from performance-based bonus payments to shared savings programs administered through accountable care organizations (ACOs). Why, then, do we still face rising healthcare costs, continued threat of Medicare Trust Fund insolvency, a widening health equity gap, and growing primary care provider burnout? In our view, the short answer: we lack technology and infrastructure that enables individual providers to be incentivized by value, and take on risk.", "Acknowledging my own bias as a physician, I believe providers \u2014 in particular primary care physicians (PCPs) \u2014 are the central decision nodes whose incentives have been repeatedly overlooked in prior iterations of value-based payment models.

Instead of running through 22 separately billable patient encounters each day, providers could be paid on a per-patient-per-month fee structure, with access to upside (and downside) financial risk based on each patient\u2019s overall health (and total cost of care). In this regime, providers might shift towards managing panels of patients, grouped by condition. They could be empowered to focus on prevention, and always-on triage. They could make their own informed decisions about when to spend an hour with a patient in their home vs when to simply check in with a patient over text message. And PCPs deeply embedded in their local communities could remain financially independent, retain their unique practice styles, engage their patients to address health inequities day in and day out \u2014 and be recognized for the long-term value they provide their patients.", "But until we radically change the financial incentives for individual providers, the outcomes will not change.

Take a CRM, for example. The basics are creating new rows or updating existing records in a database/spreadsheet, but the enterprise version will not only require restrictions on access to certain fields based on user groups, but also joins with other data sources.\u00a0", "No matter how hard we try, there will never be enough SaaS products or internal engineering resources to fill in these CRUD app gaps.

In the first three years, they ran through multiple iterations, talked to thousands of business users, deprecated five early prototypes, until landing on the current version of Stacker in early 2020. Since then, hundreds of teams built apps on Stacker to power their most critical business processes, from onboarding new vendors to managing existing client interactions. They quadrupled revenue and their user base in nine months. Stacker apps are used at large enterprises, like Adobe, Samsung, and Segment, and at government organizations and nonprofits, like TED, which uses Stacker to create the complex, bespoke software required to filter through the thousands of applications for their TED Fellows Program each year.\u201d\u00a0", "This is only the beginning of their journey. Teams in large enterprises are building not just one, but multiple apps in Stacker. As Stacker supports more data sources beyond Airtable, Google Sheets, and Salesforce, we\u2019ll see more functional teams become Stacker builders and join data across several internal systems. What used to take weeks, or even months, for internal engineering teams to build will be achieved in hours by a business operator. The apps will be ready-to-use and version controlled, with role-based-access-control and SSO built-in.

Efficient, powerful code search enables a whole host of use cases: accelerated development cycles, making large scale code changes, onboarding to a new codebase, addressing security threats, tracing lineage and root-cause incidents, and more.\u00a0", "In chatting with customers about the significance of universal code search, we heard over and over from developers: \u201cI can\u2019t live without Sourcegraph, but I didn\u2019t know I needed it until I tried it.\u201d In the same way we made do with encyclopedias before Google search existed, developers settled (and too often continue to settle) on limiting search to whatever their local integrated development environments (\u201cIDE\u201d) could handle, relying on screenshots to share code snippets, or sitting side-by-side to walk through complex code logic. When the pandemic accelerated the shift to a new way of working, the simmering demand for a tool like Sourcegraph boiled over and necessitated a better way for developers to build and collaborate.\u00a0", "The ability to focus developer\u2019s mental calories on the highest and best use of time and collaborate by sharing and tracing code quickly via Sourcegraph has led to viral growth. While many engineering orgs are already using Sourcegraph wall-to-wall, what stood out even more to us was the organic developer love. In many cases, a single developer or team became the spark that led to Sourcegraph becoming the de facto standard for development across the entire organization. In the new era of enterprise sales, product led developer advocacy combined with a well-timed, top down sale is the most powerful way to grow.\u00a0", "Behind Sourcegraph is exactly the right team to create the next transformational company in developer tools. Quinn and Beyang are brilliant, mission-driven, open-minded, and relentless. They have the kind of grit we can only hope for in the best founders and we\u2019ve seen evidence of that in every single meeting we\u2019ve had with them over the years. After all, the best dev tools aren\u2019t built in a day\u2014Quinn and Beyang have been at it since 2013, fueled by their conviction that they could build the tool they needed as developers and by the mission that code search should be as universal as Google Search.\u00a0", "Today, some of the most advanced companies in the world are Sourcegraph customers\u2014from large scale players like Amazon, Uber, and Lyft to the fastest growing companies like TripActions, Plaid, and Toast. But Big Code is not just a Big Company problem or even a high tech company problem. In an era where software has become the company\u2019s interface to its customer, every company is becoming a tech company, and Big Code is driving massive complexity everywhere, which means having Sourcegraph in every developer\u2019s toolbox is more important than ever. And we\u2019re only in the early innings of adoption, for the next chapter of its story, I\u2019m thrilled that Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s Growth Fund is leading Sourcegraph\u2019s Series D with the mission of bringing universal code search to every developer.", "\u00a0", "***", "\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Investing in Flock Safety", "date": "July 13, 2021", "author": "David Ulevitch", "content": ["Two decades into the cloud computing era of software eating the world, some corners of the economy are still far behind. Unfortunately law enforcement is one of them, which not only leaves around 800,000 law enforcement officers in the United States empty handed when it comes to modern tools to do their daily jobs, but also results in a failure to equip our first responders with the best technology that can protect lives, promote impartial law enforcement, and most importantly, solve crime and save lives.\u00a0", "Today, the majority of crimes in the U.S. go unresolved. Only 46% of violent crimes are fully resolved and that number is staggeringly low (17%) for property crime. And the reality is much worse than these clearance rates would suggest since most crimes go unreported entirely.\u00a0", "Over the last several decades, the technology industry has transformed nearly all occupations, but daily operations in law enforcement aren\u2019t dissimilar from crime-fighting methods in the pre-internet era. Law enforcement spending approached $115B across state and local agencies in 2017, however the vast majority of that spending went toward labor, accounting for as high as 94% of the annual police budget in New York City, 93% in Los Angeles, and 88% in Chicago. In the field, status quo policing methods largely rely on manual labor on the ground and word-of-mouth investigation practices (e.g., \u201cDid anyone see a vehicle at the scene of the crime?\u201d). In the office, outdated operations in police agencies typically require officers to spend half of their time on administrative paperwork and manual processes. Compounding the problem even further, most urban police agencies are perpetually understaffed with no solution to the labor shortage in sight.", "Our communities deserve better, which is exactly what motivated Flock Safety founder and CEO Garrett Langley to find technology that would actually move the needle on fighting crime. After meeting with law enforcement agencies around his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, Garrett, Matt Feury, and Paige Todd got to work at their kitchen table. Three weeks later, their first prototype was ready for action.\u00a0", "Flock Safety uses computer vision to fight crime. While there is a legacy market for automated license plate detection cameras, Flock Safety far surpasses existing capabilities. Instead of only being able to search for hits on a specific license plate, Flock Safety allows law enforcement officers to query for various characteristics of a suspect vehicle, including make and model, color, paper plates, and attributes that observers may notice even if they don\u2019t catch a license plate at the scene of the crime, like a specific bumper color. The results are not just astounding from a crime solving standpoint, but the impact is a much more objective form of crime fighting. Finding an exact vehicle instead of pulling over every \u201csilver sedan\u201d is safer for citizens and law enforcement alike.\u00a0", "As with most new technology that leverages software and machine learning over expensive hardware optics, Flock Safety devices cost an order of magnitude less than the leading incumbents, which allows their customers to cover far more points of interest in their jurisdictions than their budgets could afford with legacy technology. What magnifies the power of Flock Safety even more is that the digital evidence can be pooled across different law enforcement agencies for a short period of time, making it more powerful as adoption scales within a community and across the U.S. more broadly. That means that a kidnapped child being driven across county or state lines can be found much more quickly, and safely.", "The power of Flock Safety is in its network. The more devices deployed, the more evidence there is to solve crimes. This network effect was first catalyzed within neighborhood homeowner\u2019s associations, which were the original focus in the go-to-market motion and still account for over 40% of the business. Success fighting crime in neighborhoods then attracted law enforcement agencies, which now represents the majority of the business.\u00a0", "The results of Flock Safety in action are astounding: frequently finding stolen vehicles, substantially reducing residential burglary, and in more dangerous situations, empowering law enforcement to intervene in Amber alerts and resolve lethal crimes that would otherwise go unsolved. Beyond protecting property, Flock Safety is literally helping to save lives. One of their earliest customers in the greater Atlanta area put it best: \u201cFlock is the single most effective tool we have ever used.\u201d Unsurprisingly these results earn Flock Safety a level of stakeholder admiration that is rarely seen with the legacy vendors selling into law enforcement. In only four years since the company started, Flock Safety already plays a role in 1% of crimes solved in the United States, putting it well on the way to earning its place as an industry standard in every law enforcement agency. At a time of increasing pressure for law enforcement to operate efficiently and improve their results for American society, Flock Safety is the answer.", "We are often in search of \u201cn of 1\u201d startups, companies who are effectively the only game in town going after a massive opportunity in shaping the future. Flock Safety certainly belongs in this mix of important companies. In only four years of operating, Flock Safety devices have been deployed in over 40 states around the U.S. Not only is Flock Safety off to the races building a one-in-a-generation business, but it\u2019s also delivering tremendous value to society by making our communities safer.

The dynamic of ballooning spend and a \u201cblank check\u201d mentality toward cloud has become a hot button issue for both engineering and finance leaders. However, actually understanding how to measure and anticipate cloud costs remains opaque due to the complexity around cloud billing.\u00a0", "The lack of visibility around resource consumption paired with cloud providers\u2019 clunky pricing and billing systems has left many companies in a lurch when it comes to managing their cloud costs and resulted in margin erosion (as explored recently in this post). Cloud costs can account for 70-80% of total COGS for fast scaling companies. Even then, most companies are still tracking their cloud spend manually via spreadsheets, if at all, without truly understanding how to prioritize and improve the bottom line.\u00a0", "The first step for anyone looking to optimize this enormous bucket of spend starts with visibility, and this is where Vantage comes in.\u00a0", "Vantage is building a cloud cost transparency platform that helps everyone \u2013 from developers to enterprises \u2013 analyze, report, and collaborate on and optimize their cloud infrastructure costs. With a single click, developers and financial operations teams can connect an AWS account and see spending broken down by resource type and trends over time. It also offers machine learning-powered reporting on forecasted resource consumption and projected spend by service or by custom tags. Most importantly, Vantage provides the transparency all teams need to control and optimize their cloud spend.\u00a0", "This is not the first time a company has set out to unravel the lengthy cloud bill. Incumbents in the space have kept the buyers away with long implementation cycles and shockingly high prices. New demands in the cloud-native era have ushered in the need for a next generation solution.", "First, managing cloud spend is a multi-disciplinary problem, involving participation from cloud engineers, leadership, and finops teams. Even though the latter two roles are served with existing solutions, engineers are often left out of the conversation. We\u2019re seeing more and more cloud engineering and devops teams taking on managing cloud spending, and demanding well-integrated solutions to their existing infrastructure. At its core, Vantage is built for developers but also serves the broader team.", "Second, companies have historically only paid attention to their cloud spend after it exceeds tens of millions of dollars or in advance of a major financial event, like an IPO. Thus the existing solutions in the market are tailored for large companies with dedicated teams. However, cloud spend is not a one-time nor an at-scale problem. It is an operational problem that requires ongoing monitoring and improvements that enable early corrective action. Vantage is designed to be operational \u2013 with the upcoming notification and alerting capabilities, teams can take their minds off of constantly watching the dashboards.", "Additionally, simplicity is an underrated trait especially for complex dev tools. The number of AWS services are daunting and often have complex, hierarchical nesting several layers deep.

First, product and user research are some of the fastest growing teams in an organization (and the role itself is one of the top 15 emerging jobs in the U.S.), as they often serve as the internal champions for the customer. Secondly, it means that many more stakeholders in an organization need to listen to the customer in order to deliver against their needs.

However, tools to help product leaders understand customer needs are still fragmented and insufficient, leading to long research cycles and scattered insights across an org \u2013\u00a0and taking up time that product managers and user researchers could be spending actually speaking with customers.\u00a0", "And staying connected to customers becomes especially important because while analytics tools exist to help quantitatively measure how a product is performing, there are currently no modern products that measure qualitatively how customers feel, why they take a specific action, and what they want to see in the future. The answers to those questions are often far more nuanced and important in driving company decisions, and to be a product-led company, it\u2019s critical for teams to know the why behind user behavior to best serve their customers.\u00a0", "That\u2019s why we were so excited to meet Ryan and learn about what he was building at Sprig.

There are marketing teams using Sprig to tailor landing pages, design teams using it to test prototypes, and more teams regularly discovering new use cases that work for them every day. This is incredibly exciting to see because it means Sprig is democratizing user research across an organization and allowing anyone to keep a pulse on the customer.\u00a0", "As part of our diligence process, we chatted with dozens of customers, each of whom said Sprig was an integral part of how they made strategic decisions as a business. Even more importantly, every single customer sang Ryan\u2019s praises. And as we\u2019ve gotten to know Ryan over the past year, it\u2019s easy to see why.

I think this will be as profound as when Shopify first enabled millions of sellers to list products online, or Substack bringing new recurring revenue streams to authors, writers, and journalists. Along these lines Maven embraces a new trend that leans away from small slices of advertising revenue. Instead, Maven\u2019s creators can charge substantial fees \u2014 often hundreds or thousands of dollars per student \u2014 which in turn allows them to increase the quality and comprehensiveness of their content over time.

Since then, scientists have pursued multiple approaches to discover, evolve, or design novel AAVs with enhanced properties and characteristics. Can we find an AAV that specifically targets, say, the central nervous system in order to treat neurodegenerative diseases? Or design an AAV that\u2019s easier to manufacture? It\u2019s a hard mountain to climb. AAV capsids (shells) are delicate, complex 20-sided structures. When it comes to manipulating them in order to improve them, one false step can result in a precipitous \u201cfall\u201d that breaks the capsid. And even if you can make progress on optimizing one property (like tissue-specific targeting), it often comes at the significant expense of others (like manufacturability and immunogenicity). Which is why traditional approaches\u2014directed evolution or rational design, or even the hope of discovering other naturally occurring AAVs\u2014have rarely yielded improved capsids. A more powerful approach is needed to escape the limitations of natural AAVs and fully realize the promise of gene therapy.", "Dyno\u2019s Ascent", "In rock climbing, a \u201cdyno\u201d is a rapid move across a rock face in order to reach the next hold. Eric Kelsic, who studied physics at Caltech and trained at George Church\u2019s famed Harvard lab, was thinking about the toughest, most valuable problems artificial intelligence (AI) could tackle in biology\u2014and realized that AI was an ideal tool to accelerate the search for better AAVs. In 2018, he teamed up with machine learning expert (and fellow Church Lab alum) Sam Sinai, Adrian Veres, Tomas Bjorklund, seasoned biotech entrepreneur Alan Crane, and George Church to found Dyno Therapeutics. Dyno\u2019s mission is to create AI-designed AAV vectors with transformative delivery properties to cover the vast landscape of human diseases. The company\u2019s CapsidMap platform comprehensively surveys AAV topography and finds the best routes to optimize multiple parameters in parallel in order to rapidly generate more efficient, highly specific, and less immunogenic AAVs. In comparison to traditional methods, Dyno\u2019s AI-driven approach has already proven to be highly prolific: they have designed enhanced liver-targeting variants of naturally occurring AAV capsids and screened billions of potential sequences in silico using machine learning models to design thousands of viable synthetic AAV capsids\u2014validating the use of advanced machine learning models to design highly diverse, functional AAV capsids.In addition to creating transformative therapies, productive bio platforms can enable novel business models too. If AI is an ideal tool for designing a diverse array of novel AAVs with varied functions, AI-designed AAVs can accelerate and reshape the entire gene therapy industry. From its inception, Dyno chose to eschew the traditional approach of investing in its own product pipeline (i.e. developing its own gene therapies) and instead decided to build the platform that will serve as the horizontal \u201cinfrastructure\u201d layer to supply novel AAVs to power all gene therapies. Dyno\u2019s approach has already proven to be highly prolific here too: the company has signed partnerships, potentially worth over $4 billion in aggregate, to develop next-generation AAV vectors for gene therapy leaders like Sarepta in muscle diseases, Novartis in eye diseases, and Roche/Spark Therapeutics for the central nervous system and liver.

Later that year, Howard published a seminal paper in this space with many of those same collaborators titled \u201cZexe: Enabling Decentralized Private Computation.\u201d It describes how it\u2019s possible to change the way that transactions on a blockchain are verified so that it can be done privately and more efficiently. The trick lies in the use of a cryptographic primitive that allows any participant in the network to create a short mathematical proof that a transaction was processed correctly, but that doesn\u2019t reveal any details about the transaction itself. The magical primitive that makes this possible is called a zero-knowledge proof (or zk-proof).

Privacy is important as a feature, not just because it protects users\u2019 personal data, but also because it fundamentally extends the design space for applications. There are things that can be built with a private smart contract that are simply impossible to build with a transparent one. For example, a simple game that hands out cards face-down to different players would need some way to make sure that those cards aren\u2019t immediately visible to everyone playing.

It encompasses the shift of trillions of dollars of IT spend, and it has changed how we build, deploy, and buy software. In fact, one of the most common conversations I participate in as the board member of B2B software companies is how to leverage the cloud to sell more.\u00a0", "A very important part of that discussion is cloud marketplaces. More and more cloud marketplaces (such as the AWS, GCP, and Azure marketplaces) are a primary channel for B2B vendors. However, listing products, attracting customers, and tracking usage are still somewhat of a dark art. Companies who know how to do it well have a huge advantage, but in-house knowledge is very hard to come by and requires a tremendous amount of engineering work and ongoing maintenance.\u00a0", "Cloud marketplaces aren\u2019t just one more channel for selling software \u2013 it\u2019s becoming the channel. The entire manner in which software is consumed is shifting from high ACV deals via direct sales, to bottom up, community or product-led growth. Modern software sales is more about landing small deals, tracking usage, and finding expansion opportunities than ever before, and the existing GTM tooling just isn\u2019t suited for this motion.\u00a0", "This is where Tackle comes in. Tackle is the best way for B2B companies to monetize products sold through the leading cloud marketplaces. I first learned about Tackle when the company came up in conversation at a board meeting I was attending. I then reached out to a few other founders in the portfolio and realized most of them were already Tackle customers as well. And they all said the same thing: If you want to generate revenue through the cloud marketplaces, Tackle is the solution.", "Incredibly curious to learn more, I reached out to the Tackle team and was absolutely stunned by the company and what they\u2019d accomplished. Even though they had taken relatively little funding, they had over 200 customers, including a large swath of the a16z portfolio and many other leading tech companies. And each time we spoke to their customers, they raved about how Tackle had far exceeded their expectations around ease of use, and how effective they were in helping to attract more customers. And all of this from a company that was hardly burning any cash despite tremendous growth.", "Behind it all is exactly the right team to create the next iconic sales tooling company. I first met John Jahnke, the CEO, over the phone and it was like speaking with an old friend. We have similar backgrounds. We both worked in the EMC conglomerate \u2013 he on the Pivotal side and I at VMware \u2013 so we both deeply appreciate the importance and power of enterprise software sales. I then met with the two founders, Dillon Woods and Brian Denker, over Zoom and it was clear their combined technical, product, and operational backgrounds were instrumental in creating such a phenomenon. We truly believe they are galvanizing a new category, one that will be necessary for every B2B software vendor to use going forward.\u00a0", "So I\u2019m delighted to announce that I will be leading Tackle\u2019s Series B and taking a board seat. Of all the trends I track, the shift in GTM is the most broad reaching. It affects not only developer-led companies, but all of B2B \u2013 from apps and security, to productivity and core infrastructure.

Most homeowners spend hours shopping for the best rate and diligently choosing their mortgage originator (e.g., a bank like Wells Fargo, a non-bank like Rocket Mortgage, or a newer player like Loansnap), but what happens to this diligently chosen mortgage after close? More often than not, monthly payments are sent to an entirely different entity, one that can change several times over the life of the mortgage. It is ironic that aspiring homeowners carefully select their originator, but then have no control over the company they\u2019re expected to interact with for up to 30 years.\u00a0", "The company to whom homeowners remit their mortgage payments is called the mortgage servicer. To those not in the financial industry, that term can seem ironic\u2014there is nothing service-oriented about most mortgage servicers (they average an abysmal NPS score of 16).", "Want to check your balance? You\u2019re likely visiting a website that was built in the 1980s and doesn\u2019t work on mobile. Try to set up autopay or request a payoff letter? You\u2019ll find yourself printing, signing & faxing paperwork.\u00a0 Want to figure out the status of your escrow account? That\u2019ll likely require 15 calls to the call center before you get an answer. Moreover, who do you turn to when you lose your job and can\u2019t pay the full amount of your mortgage? Whose job is it to inform you of your options and to help you during this stressful time? In theory, all of these are the job of the mortgage servicer\u2014a company you likely haven\u2019t heard of and most definitely didn\u2019t choose to be in business with.\u00a0", "More concerningly, even before COVID hit, 50 percent of Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck, often facing uncertainty in paying their mortgage each month. Now, more than 5 percent of mortgages are currently on forbearance payment plans. That\u2019s nearly 3 million homeowners who are concerned about their ability to pay for, and hence stay, in their homes long term. When you consider both the financial scale of the asset class and the personal importance of the assets being managed by these antiquated servicers who aren\u2019t set up to manage the situation, it\u2019s both shocking and worrying. Even though the CFPB continues to file enforcement actions, little has changed.\u00a0\u00a0", "As the adage goes, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste. The perils facing many homeowners will add focus to the opportunity: a new mortgage servicer built from the ground up and its potential to benefit everyone in the mortgage value chain.", "For homeowners, imagine you could have a trusted confidant to not only help you better digest this complex financial product, but also to navigate the process when financial challenges arise. Can you pause your payments? Pay a lower rate? When do you have to make up for the missed payments? Or even more crucially, what can you do to stay in the home you worked so hard to buy? In extreme cases, the right plan will make the difference between staying in your home and foreclosure. In times of lesser financial stress, when rates drop, you\u2019re automatically alerted that you should refinance and are guided through the process.\u00a0", "For originators, a modern, software-driven, regulatorily compliant servicer will become a competitive advantage in the market. Today, consumers generally choose their lender based on a streamlined application process and the best rates. However, this has commoditized the lender\u2019s relationship with the consumer, making it difficult for the originator to leverage and maintain its connectivity with the borrower. This is further compounded by the fact that the vast majority of originators do not have the size nor the infrastructure required to keep the mortgage servicing. Hence, they lose the relationship with the homeowner after origination (servicing has traditionally been a low margin business that only makes economic sense at scale). A tech-forward servicer with higher gross margins and easy onboarding processes could support lenders at any scale. In addition, they could provide the tools necessary for the lender to continue directly working with the homeowner throughout the life of the mortgage.\u00a0", "For investors, the economic case for a new full-stack servicer is even stronger. The average cost to service a performing loan has risen $59 to $156 from 2008 to 2013. For non-performing loans over the same time period, it\u2019s jumped from $480 to $2,350. Why? First, there are hundreds of pages of regulation that differ on a state-by-state basis. Most servicers were built in the 1960s and still operate on blue screens. As more regulation was enacted over the years, it was nearly impossible for the servicers to update their software, so more bodies were thrown at the problem. As a result, mortgage servicing is an extremely low-margin business. A new software servicer will reduce the transaction cost (software handles most tasks, not people in call centers), reduce credit loss (by helping consumers avoid foreclosure), and increase returns. Furthermore, if the consumer is comfortable being more honest and transparent with a servicer they believe will present them with their best options, it should take excess costs (like legal expenses) out of the system and lead to better outcomes for all parties involved.", "Given this massive market filled with antiquated players, why hasn\u2019t there been a parade of new entrants? Let\u2019s look at what is required. First, you need a team deeply steeped in consumer finance (and specifically mortgage) regulation that is highly credible to regulators. Second, that same team needs the engineering expertise required to translate thousands of pages of regulation into modular, extensible code with a modern, mobile-friendly interface. Third, this team needs credibility in the mortgage world, where it can convince owners of mortgage servicing rights to take a chance on an unrated new company in the space.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0", "This trifecta of capabilities is the unicorn skill set possessed by the team at Valon.

He told me about a new startup he was building\u2014a mobile-first social app that would bring people together. He had launched the app within the startup community, but had big plans to take it to a much wider audience. The startup I\u2019m talking about isn\u2019t Clubhouse, but rather a company Paul started in 2012 called Highlight. Highlight explored how to bring people together who were in physical proximity to each other\u2014so that when you were at the same museum or party as a friend, you could say hi\u2014and it was on the cutting edge of what you could do with mobile phones at the time. That company eventually sold to Pinterest, where Paul took time to delve deeper into social products in the context of visual curation.\u00a0", "I was happy to reconnect with Paul last year when he told me he was working on something new. By then, he had teamed up with his cofounder and friend Rohan Seth, a seasoned entrepreneur and technical genius who spent years at Google working on Android and Maps, in addition to starting his own companies. The pair was launching a new product to bring people together, this time over audio, making it easy for people to both talk and listen. No, not Clubhouse\u2014yet. This product, called Talkshow, aimed to make podcasting easier by helping users find other speakers and streamlining the usual tools required.\u00a0", "You may be sensing a pattern! Paul has been working on social products for the better part of a decade, iterating and trying out new ideas, learning from past experiments, and steadily working toward a product that brings people together in new and creative ways.", "This brings us to Clubhouse, which Paul and Rohan launched after Talkshow. Clubhouse is a new audio-first social app that makes it easy to talk to other people. The product is organized into a series of user-created \u201crooms\u201d where you can talk with others, some of whom are speakers and others who are just listening. People can move fluidly between conversations as speakers or listeners, covering myriad topics.", "The moment we saw it, we were deeply excited. Today we\u2019re pleased to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is investing in Clubhouse. Most importantly, we\u2019re excited to partner with Paul and Rohan as they build an amazing team, community, and product. Many folks at the firm have worked with Paul, Rohan, and the Clubhouse team\u2014everyone from the marketing, talent, editorial, and market development teams to Chris Lyons at the Cultural Leadership Fund, who introduced valuable creators to the app in its earliest days. We believe Clubhouse will be a meaningful addition to the world, one that increases empathy and provides new ways for people to talk to each other (at a time when we need it more than ever).", "Clubhouse was released in early 2020. At the beginning, it was just a single \u201croom\u201d where the founders hung out all the time. You could pop inside, have a great audio-only conversation with Rohan and Paul, and leave whenever you wanted. Clubhouse started out like many new Silicon Valley apps do, with friends and family in the tech community trying out an alpha or beta product, but it quickly grew as Paul and Rohan built new features at a rapid clip. The initial trial users started inviting more people and the Clubhouse community swiftly encompassed a burgeoning and diverse set of people and conversations. Groups quickly began to form around hobbies, cultures, careers, and curiosities.\u00a0 It soon became obvious to me, as my time in the app reached more than a dozen hours a week, that Clubhouse is something special. It has been incredible to watch the community grow from a few hundred people to nearly two million weekly users. Paul and Rohan continue to use the app frequently to engage with users while working to build the bandwidth to support the app\u2019s expansion.", "Clubhouse could not have come at a better time for social media. It reinvents the category in all the right ways, from the content consumption experience to the way people engage each other, while giving power to its creators.\u00a0", "In a social media landscape that typically compels you to spend hours staring at a screen\u2014often distractedly flitting between multiple screens\u2014Clubhouse lets you multitask while you listen. Like podcasts, you can listen while you take a walk, fold laundry, or work out. It can also be the centerpiece of your evening, like attending a lecture or talk. But it\u2019s also interactive, so if you have something to say, you can raise your hand and chime in. Because you\u2019re listening to people talk, Clubhouse is about a real-time exchange of ideas, not just consuming highly-edited, static content. It\u2019s a fresh experience that brings humanity and context to online social engagement.", "Clubhouse lets users communicate nuanced, detailed ideas in conversation; not everything needs to be bite-size or tl;dr. It\u2019s the opposite of a video clip or a short post because it rewards discussion and exploration. I\u2019ve seen rooms where people talk long into the night, eventually falling asleep with the app open. I\u2019ve listened to many interactions among people from different sides of the political spectrum, and it often results in a conversation that\u2019s not unlike what you\u2019d get at a great dinner party. And while some degree of conflict and misunderstanding may be inevitable\u2014no social company is free of these challenges\u2014the team is committed to rethinking the ways we communicate with one another online and is working to build a trusted, safe space for people to be heard.", "And at the center of Paul and Rohan\u2019s vision for Clubhouse are the creators. These are the members of the community who organize rooms, invite their friends, and host weekly shows. They are the heart and soul of the product. The team has been building features to make it easier to moderate rooms and clubs, as well as working with creators to develop a business model that rewards the entire ecosystem as Clubhouse\u2019s community grows. I love that this orientation contrasts with the typical ad-based business model that has supported social networks in the past. This centers the experience around community and quality, rather than clicks and volume.", "We look forward to partnering with the Clubhouse team and helping build its community, product, and business.

The Moov community has attracted hundreds of payments engineers, including those at the top five banks who ran $4Trillion of previously cleared transactions through Moov\u2019s ACH library to test its fraud models. These payments represented bill payments, mortgages, car loans, and direct payroll deposits that were previously processed on a mainframe running COBOL.\u00a0 As a result, Moov was able to collaborate with the community to discover and fix 1600 edge cases and write test cases against them, thus hardening the code base for all to benefit.\u00a0 The power of open source will become even more important as the use cases become more diverse and customers of all sizes become more reliant on Moov\u2019s infrastructure. Customers who build with \u201cMoov inside\u201d can feel confident that their infrastructure is battle-tested and extensible.", "To illustrate the power of this approach, let\u2019s look at the outdated and cumbersome primitives currently used in money movement.

In fact, the average Fortune 500 company spends 50-60% of total spend on labor, and that percentage is even higher for an early stage startup. Companies are now recognizing that transparency around compensation is at the heart of all recruiting, promotions, and employee retention conversations.\u00a0\u00a0", "Today, compensation is broken for both companies and employees. Companies typically manage compensation in a manual, unwieldy way with limited data. Chief HR Officers (CHROs) are forced to plan and communicate compensation across dispersed spreadsheets and emails between HR, finance, managers, and the candidate. To benchmark offers, companies currently pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for manually collected annual compensation data; this data is immediately stale and often difficult for companies to put in their own context. Employees and candidates suffer, too. They are often left in the dark about how to interpret and value the equity portion of their compensation. As a result, employees often feel undervalued and churn, and candidates struggle to understand the upside of their equity compared to their Google/Facebook offers. The entire process, which is meant to reward employees, is often painful and leads to suboptimal outcomes.", "As I spent time talking to CHRO leaders and founders trying to address the problem of compensation transparency, one company clearly surfaced to the top \u2013 Pave (formerly Trove), which offers a suite of real-time tools that helps companies plan and communicate total compensation. Today, Pave offers a single source of truth around compensation data for CHROs to do merit cycle and scenario planning, and for candidates and employees to visualize how their compensation evolves over time. And all of this integrates with HR information systems (HRIS), eliminating hours of tedious data entry.\u00a0\u00a0", "Customers like Checkr, Allbirds, Thoughtspot, and Instabase rely on Pave to manage compensation planning and communication.

Let me explain.\u00a0", "For decades, networks have been defined in terms of the individual endpoints they connect. With workloads running on physical machines, we wired physical switches, load-balancers, and firewalls, and defined connectivity in terms of the IP addresses assigned to each machine. When we shifted to connecting virtual machines (VMs), we created virtual switches, virtual load-balancers, and virtual firewalls, but again thought of connectivity in terms of individual VM endpoints.\u00a0", "In modern systems we rarely think about connecting machines and wires, or virtual machines, or even containers, really. Instead, we\u2019re concerned with connecting microservices, cloud services, APIs, and the higher level protocols and systems used to connect them. The past was IP addresses, ports, vNICs and VLANS. Now, it is service identity, gRPC, Kafka, distributed data stores, remote APIs, etc.\u00a0\n", "Kubernetes has emerged as the cloud\u2019s operating system, stitching together nodes (the majority of them Linux) and enabling microservices. But Kubernetes breaks a lot of the old school networking and security tooling that assumed an immutable physical server. And so, simply, we need a new networking and security layer that provides cloud native visibility, security, and control of these high level abstractions in a way that is secure, seamless to deploy, and does not compromise application performance. That new layer is Cilium.\u00a0", "Cilium is built around eBPF and runs within the Linux kernel, making it seamless to deploy and highly performant. Linux is the operating system for many of the nodes underlying Kubernetes. And wherever there\u2019s Linux, security comes down to a kernel being asked to do something. Until recently, that kernel, while powerful, was relatively unintelligent, with layers of complexity built on top.", "With eBPF, it\u2019s possible to write a program and embed it directly into the kernel. A common analogy: eBPF brings to the Linux kernel what JavaScript brought to the browser. With eBPF, you can see and control what is happening at the API level, showing the remote API calls being invoked and the data that they are being passed. Cilium + eBPF is far more than API-aware visibility, it\u2019s a fundamentally more powerful way to do networking in cloud environments, from traditional configurations on up, that allows for more robust program tracing, observability, and monitoring. But it\u2019s hard to provide a full technical overview of something as foundational as eBPF and Cilium in a blog post such as this, so rather than attempt to do that, I strongly recommend you watch this video from Isovalent Cofounder Thomas Graf.", "Building something like Cilium, and an enterprise offering around it, is no small feat. There are few teams in the industry who have the right combined background of low-level networking, Linux kernel intervals, large distributed systems, and open source community building to pull it off. We believe that the team at Isovalent is hands down the most equipped for the job, not just because of their work creating eBPF and Cilium, but because they have decades of experiences in the foundational technologies that led up to it.", "Dan Wendlandt along with Thomas, the cofounders of Isovalent, are two of the most respected talents in the software defined networking space.

The CFO\u2019s office spends so much time closing the books, nagging business unit leaders to fill out resource planning spreadsheets, and manually creating reports that they hardly have the time to be the strategic partner the CEO needs. And those in the company that are empowered to manage spend don\u2019t have access to the data. I witnessed this firsthand as the general manager of US card and consumer at Credit Karma. Despite having sophisticated access to product insights, I had very little visibility into financial information, which limited my ability to invest in efforts focused on expanding margin or extending runway, for example. As we rely increasingly on data to guide important business decisions, it follows that a new set of products will be built for the leaders outside of the CFO\u2019s office (like Runway), while a very different set of tools will empower those within the finance team (some of which we\u2019ve outlined here).", "Why Siqi and Arya?

Employers and employees had a tacit agreement: employers provided a stable income and job security, while employees committed to working in a traditional office environment and management structure, often for life. We\u2019ve seen a rapid evolution of this model over the last few decades, partially catalyzed by tech companies moving towards a more egalitarian and meritocratic approach when building teams of knowledge workers.

Risk-based payment models under value-based care (VBC)\u2014which reward providers who keep patients out of high-cost facilities\u2014have gained steam, and the \u201csilver tsunami\u201d of the growing elderly population in our country increasingly prefers to \u201cage in place\u201d. By 2018, total home health spend in the U.S. had risen to $108B. And now, the COVID-19 pandemic has given most patients no choice but to stay home, even as they deal with ongoing, non-COVID-related healthcare needs. This current public health crisis has put home healthcare squarely in the spotlight, and illuminated all the gaps in our current ability to fully support patients where they are.", "What is needed to deliver high-quality home-based care? First, a mobile and distributed clinical staff (e.g. nurses, physical therapists, social workers, etc) is obviously foundational, as is support for the social determinants of health, like access to healthy food. The ability to remotely monitor patients, take mobile measurements during home visits, and communicate amongst distributed care teams is paramount. Efficient drug supply chain logistics are critical as well, so patients can access and comply with their medication regimens. Finally, many patients\u2014especially those recently discharged from a hospital\u2014often need durable medical equipment (DME) to manage their conditions, like ventilators, catheters, or prosthetics.\u00a0", "This type of equipment represents a $60B market today, and is the second fastest growing area of healthcare spend. Utter the acronym \u2018DME\u2019 to any payor or provider executive, and it\u2019s likely you\u2019ll get their attention fast. Not only does this category keep rising in spend, it also has significant downstream cost and outcome implications when its processes are poorly managed. For example, discharges from hospitals are often delayed because of the inability to reliably order DME for the patients who need it in their homes. A whopping 20-40% of hospital readmissions can be attributable to a patient having the wrong equipment or delays in home delivery.\u00a0", "And anyone who has personally dealt with DME knows how broken the patient experience is. Imagine your dad who has COPD being sent home from the hospital with paper-based instructions (written in esoteric terminology) for using live oxygen, waiting in respiratory distress for his oxygen equipment to arrive at his house; 3 days later, he learns that the DME company sent too few oxygen tanks to last until the next delivery date, resulting in having to call the doctor for a revised prescription and insurance authorization, which takes another 5 days. This time, to save yourself from the delay of mail delivery, you decide to just drive to the local mom-and-pop DME retail store to pick one up, if they have the right model in stock. But before you can get there, your dad deteriorates in the middle of the night and ends up back in the emergency room. And that\u2019s just with one piece of equipment; many post-acute patients need 3 or more devices to be able to manage their care at home.", "The fact that most DME providers aren\u2019t able to provide virtual services is another major friction point. DME orders are usually placed manually by discharge coordinators at the hospital, through phone calls and faxes\u2014a slow and antiquated process to begin with. But as COVID has pulled front-line staff into new priority areas, patients have been increasingly left to their own devices to figure out how to get what they need. This can feel ridiculously hard; DME providers rarely have websites, let alone any means to allow patients to self-serve or check order status online. Payors, too, rarely offer a means to check the status of authorization requests for reimbursed DME, except for through phone calls to their now overburdened and low-staffed call centers. The COVID crisis has pushed us to a tipping point we were already reaching: the DME process must be transformed so that it can actually meet the needs of sick, home-bound patients across the country.", "I first met Vijay Kedar when Tomorrow Health was a vision built around the concept of \u201creimbursed commerce for home health\u201d. Vijay had seen first-hand the challenges of home healthcare while overseeing the care of his mother, as she recovered at home from a lung disease. He saw DME as an important first segment to tackle, drawing from the difficulties his family had experienced in coordinating and managing a range of medical equipment and supplies critical for his mother\u2019s recovery. Since it was such a fundamental component of home health patients\u2019 needs, especially in the elderly population where 40% of Medicare beneficiaries utilize some sort of DME, building a platform to serve that segment would enable the company to improve the care of a significant base of home health patients before expanding further.\u00a0", "Vijay had previously run the Texas market operations for Oscar Health, and he had insight from that experience on what was needed to drive true change in the care delivery landscape. Rather than try to paper\u00a0 over a broken infrastructure, he sought to rebuild that infrastructure entirely, launching Tomorrow as a full-stack, accredited provider that could own the end-to-end home health journey for patients, and create true value for payors through direct cost savings and improved care management. Vijay\u2019s co-founder, Gabe Flateman, the co-founding CTO of Casper, brought another set of superpowers to the team: how to build a modern tech stack that could rewire the end-to-end supply chain and payment logistics of an ossified industry, and transform the customer experience through simplicity and high-touch, virtual service.", "Vijay and Gabe mapped out all the components of the end-to-end home health service delivery model, and identified the key areas where a grounds-up rebuild was both needed and possible: namely, the logistics side of home healthcare, which is a combination of real-time supply-demand matching and end-to-end supply chain management; the reimbursement side, which means aggregating and streamlining complex medical policies and reimbursement rules across hundreds of health plans nationwide; and last but not least, the customer experience side, for both providers and patients. There is no lack of opportunity to enable tech-enabled automation, optimization, and transparency across that landscape. Bringing together all of those components into a unified platform will be a step change for the industry in and of itself.", "This pandemic has forced many healthcare companies to shift and rethink their strategies in order to pave a new path for themselves through a new and rapidly changing set of norms. Tomorrow Health only needed to accelerate its already existing plans to ensure that their vision for tech-enabled home health could be fulfilled for not just those impacted by COVID, but for all patients\u2014as quickly and as smoothly as possible. It\u2019s a privilege to be backing Vijay, Gabe, and the whole Tomorrow Health team as they build a better home health experience for all of us and our families.", "\u00a0\u00a0"]}, {"title": "Investing in Fishtown Analytics, the makers of dbt", "date": "April 22, 2020", "author": "Martin Casado", "content": ["Editor\u2019s note: Fishtown Analytics has rebranded as dbt Labs.", "Every so often there is a software project released that has so much momentum and buzz, you start to run into it all the time.

For ETL, complex transformation pipelines were built at the data source. However, cloud data warehouses have finally made it cost effective to store all of a company\u2019s data in a central location, and we no longer need to transform data before we load it. In short, ETL has become ELT \u2013 \u201cExtract, Load, Transform.\u201d", "In ELT, data is first extracted from the sources, using a tool like Fivetran (also an a16z investment), loaded into the cloud data warehouse, and then transformed into the format needed for analytics processing. Further, because all of the data sits in the same location, the transformations can be far more sophisticated and draw on data from diverse sources. ELT is both simpler and more powerful than the traditional ETL model, and we strongly believe it is the future for getting data into the analytics stack.", "So where does dbt fit in all of this? It is the leading open source tool for doing transformations. In other words, it is the T in ELT.", "There are a number of reasons dbt stood out to us.

Everything from travel guides to Netflix specials, local food blogs and Instagram (of course!) shows a rising consumer interest in discovering great places to eat.\u00a0", "Talk to the people who own and operate these beloved places, however, and they will present a less romantic reality. Running a restaurant is often a tough, difficult business! There are the classic challenges of picking the right restaurant concept, marketing, hiring, training and retaining talented employees (not to mention scheduling and paying them), plus food sourcing and logistics. Most chefs would rather concentrate on the food and present a memorable experience to diners.\u00a0", "On top of that, we are in the midst of technological change: marketing restaurants alone went from an era of newspaper ads and street signs \u2013 to countless online review platforms, Twitter and Instagram accounts and digital loyalty programs. And delivery which once was limited to certain cuisine types has now become a baseline expectation for all restaurants. New delivery platforms deliver meals with the tap of a button \u2013 sometimes even by a sidewalk robot (and soon, maybe even via drone)!\u00a0", "Food delivery has been transformative, not just for customers \u2013 but for restaurateurs as well. For the restaurant industry, the opportunity is huge (at last count nearly $100B of orders worldwide). On an individual level \u2013 it allows our most beloved local brands to scale beyond their retail footprint, and reach new customers in entirely new ways at a much lower cost.", "And with this rise of new delivery platforms, restaurants can now reach new customers and grow their sales, without having to worry about how many seats they have in their dining room. But still, there are limitations, kitchen space in prime locations is often expensive, and restaurants can only handle preparing so many meals at a time. So, more recently, we\u2019ve seen the emergence of a concept called \u201cvirtual kitchens\u201d\u2013 a kitchen-only space that allows restaurants to offer delivery without having to build out a new restaurant in a high-foot traffic area. This makes it more affordable for a restaurant to get up and running and to quickly scale their customer base \u2013 without worrying about many of the complexities of a front-of-house operation.\u00a0", "With all of these shifts in mind, I\u2019m excited to share that we\u2019re investing in Virtual Kitchen Co and that I\u2019ll be joining the board.\u00a0", "Virtual Kitchen Co empowers restaurants, chefs, and food entrepreneurs to take advantage of the delivery boom without enduring the challenges of building out additional locations themselves.

Virtual Kitchen Co utilizes data to figure out where to best locate their network of kitchens, what cuisines are lacking in underserved neighborhoods, and even what ingredients should go into which dishes. By sharing and collaborating with restaurant partners, it will make the ecosystem even better.", "For consumers, the value is obvious. Our favorite local restaurants, not just national chains, will become available on the food delivery apps we already use.

But after receiving CAR T therapy, her cancer disappeared. This August, she began her freshman year of high school.\u00a0", "CAR T therapy was invented by renowned immunobiologists Dr. Carl June and Dr. Bruce Levine.

The iterative, compounding benefits of these programmable medicines offers great hope for targeting the unique challenges associated with solid tumors. Their modular aspect means that new applications will be easier to build, by reusing and repurposing common components like Lego blocks.

They focus on applying their technology to defense, law enforcement, and securing critical infrastructure.", "One unique aspect of Anduril is that while they are a defense contractor, they actually take on all the research and development (R&D) risk themselves, before selling to government. This is a significant shift in the way things have \u201calways been done\u201d because the U.S. government \u2013taxpayers \u2014 take on all the funding and R&D risk in the form of \u201ccost-plus\u201d contracting, where contractors are paid a guaranteed profit, regardless of cost. With Anduril, the U.S. government not only saves this money but diversifies its portfolio of the best defense technologies.", "Use cases for Anduril\u2019s perimeter-defense drone and sensor systems include protecting troops on base, fighting drug cartels, defending energy resources, combating wildfires, and stopping human traffickers. Many of these use cases will directly save lives \u2014 the lives of our service men and women, the people they protect, and innocent civilians caught in the middle.", "Anduril sells technology directly to the U.S. government, including the U.S. military, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and U.S. allies. Additionally, Anduril works with commercial customers that have similar needs like securing pipelines, nuclear power facilities, and other critical infrastructure. There are some in our industry who view serving such agencies and missions as controversial. We do not. Regardless of our individual political beliefs, we all benefit from the work of the men and women in these agencies and the danger in which they put themselves daily. The least we can do is work to give back by building technologies that help them accomplish their missions more effectively and more safely. There are also a lot of talented people in Silicon Valley who want to work on these missions.", "And so that\u2019s why my partner David Ulevitch and I are pleased to announce our Series B investment in Anduril, alongside their existing investors Founders Fund and General Catalyst. As with all of our investments, this is a bet on not just the technology (breathtaking) and the market (enormous) but also the people (outstanding). Palmer Luckey is a founder and technology visionary we are proud to be backing for the second time, after Oculus. Brian Schimpf and Matt Grimm bring deep expertise in defense and intelligence technology from Palantir. Joe Chen supplies valuable military experience and cutting-edge technological expertise.

The reason is because I have more listening time than \u201creading\u201d time. In fact, audio turns listening time into \u201creading\u201d and learning time: If I\u2019m making breakfast, waiting at the airport, feeding my newborn, or commuting to work, I just need to pop in some earbuds.\u00a0", "With the advent of technologies like Apple\u2019s Air Pods, connected cars during drive time, and an explosion of quality podcasting content and tools, we\u2019re beginning to enter the golden age of audio.

Content is also much easier to discover than trying to search countless podcast apps for individual podcast episodes.\u00a0", "Audio is a very different format than video and print, yet until now, we still create audiobooks as if they have to imitate the physical book form. It\u2019s time to create a new form of content native to the audio generation.

George and Taylor have a simple mission: to be the pipes that connect data from the source to the warehouse, and to do that while bearing the full burden of the massive complexity of all of those sources without exposing it to the user.

The result of all that is access for candidates to a wide selection of the *right* opportunities, a faster interview and decision process, less time filtering roles, and fewer deadend interviews.

The printing press not only brought books to more people, it brought more writers \u2014 philosophers, scientists, others \u2014 and other reading materials \u2014 like pamphlets, posters, newspapers, and novels \u2014 to the world, and in doing so, changed culture.\u00a0", "However, all this information \u2014 and the writers behind them \u2014 was still centrally distributed through the book publishers and media outlets that owned the relationship with the audience. Even though there was now a technology for creating and distributing information at scale, there was no business model for it. That is, until newspaper publisher Benjamin Day came along in the 1800s and invented a new, advertising-based model for the distribution of the written word. A newspaper cost 6 cents per issue (expensive at the time), but Day changed the economics: Charge a penny and lose money on each paper, and instead collect ad revenue on the increased circulation. The first such \u201cpenny paper,\u201d Day\u2019s New York Sun, was a huge success, birthing the modern media industry (and creating one of the earliest business models with multi-sided network effects). This model was quickly and widely copied. In fact, one of the Sun\u2019s competitors, The New York Daily Times, still exists today; it just dropped the \u201cDaily\u201d from its name.", "Since then, the internet has opened up new opportunities for media producers. A writer, streamer, or podcaster can now reach an audience of millions. Powerful tools have been created to make it easier to self-publish any format of content. Social media has allowed people to amass large followings of dedicated fans, creating a new class of jobs never thought possible: professional gamer, professional travel influencer, professional fan-fiction author, and much more.\u00a0", "But most of this is driven by advertising-based business models from the 1800s \u2014 the technology may have changed, yet the economic model is largely the same. And while advertising-based models will continue to be huge businesses, what if, in an alternate universe, Day\u2019s experiment had not worked? What if individual writers had had the opportunity to figure out how to make a living selling their novellas, newspapers, and pamphlets directly to their readers?\u00a0", "This might not have been possible back then. But today, a direct relationship between creators and audiences can unlock a new generation of professional writers and content creators. That\u2019s where Substack \u2014 which is building the leading subscription platform for independent writers to publish newsletters, podcasts, and more \u2014 comes in.\u00a0", "Substack, founded two years ago by Chris Best, Hamish McKenzie, and Jairaj Sethi, has come along at a pivotal time in the history of mass communication \u2014 what we believe is the golden age of new media. What we love most about this age is that it can free many creatives, from all kinds of backgrounds, to pursue the type of creative work they love, and on their own terms. By \u201cown terms\u201d I mean making a living on your work; owning a direct relationship with your audience; and deciding how much you want to charge them for consuming your work (if you choose to)\u2026 without having to do all the hard parts.\u00a0", "Take my own experience: When I first moved to the Bay Area over a decade ago, I started writing a blog and newsletter that began as a journal of everything I learned while trying to break into the tech industry. In my early years, I wrote furiously, multiple times per week, while also meeting people and struggling to find my voice.\u00a0But I couldn\u2019t just focus on that part. I also had to deal with hopeless complexity in the tech stack powering all of this, from personally setting up the email list software and handling constant security issues with my content management system to custom-building welcome email sequences, figuring out and implementing SEO best practices, and experimenting with landing pages. And then, to monetize, I tried ads, affiliate links, and just about everything else. It was a hell of a lot of work for a blog that spent its first year with fewer than 100 subscribers (including my sister, my mom, and my former co-workers from my hometown of Seattle \u2013 thank you!).\u00a0", "I also learned a hard lesson when Google Reader shut down in 2013, and lost nearly 100,000 RSS subscribers as a result \u2014 I had to scramble to figure out how to make sure my readers and others still found me. If you really think about it, the main asset that any content creator is building up \u2014 besides the content, of course \u2014 is their relationship with their audience. Yet most writers don\u2019t really own that relationship with their audiences; their parent media brands and other platforms do.\u00a0", "This is where Substack lets writers \u2014 of all kinds \u2014 directly connect with their readers. Because email is an open platform, it\u2019s durable: It was invented almost alongside the early days of the internet, and is here to stay. It\u2019s also portable: You can take your email addresses with you if you switch providers, offering a degree of control beyond what social media and even RSS offered in terms of audience portability (as I and many other niche content creators on the internet learned the hard way). The timeframe for building relationships over email is practically infinite; it\u2019s not limited by how long a platform survives or switches its business model.\u00a0", "Most importantly, Substack handles all of the tech powering a subscription-based platform for writers to engage with \u2014 and grow \u2014 their audiences. So when Hamish first emailed me about the idea a couple years back, when I was still working at Uber, I got it right away: Substack would make it simple for anyone to focus on just their writing, instead of having to do all the other stuff I\u2019d had to do over the years before the company existed. I began to recommend Substack to friends who were looking to start blogs or newsletters, or just wanted to share their writing in a trusted way.", "I also soon began to see Substack everywhere. People were promoting it in their Twitter profiles. I heard about it at dinners from people who were using Substack to build their first newsletters and discover audiences for their words. It was amazing to see the success Substack was having, with writers well beyond the tech industry. Benjamin Day\u2019s old competitor, The New York Times, praised it as an alternative to social media with better incentives and more reliable means of increasing readership.\u00a0", "So today, I\u2019m pleased to announce that Andreessen Horowitz is leading the Series A investment in Substack, and I will be joining the board.\u00a0", "Talk about founder-market fit: CEO and co-founder Chris was formerly the co-founder and CTO of messaging app company Kik, where he learned firsthand how to build and scale a product used by over 300 million users. He also observed how there are sometimes tradeoffs between the incentives of users and platforms, and wondered if there was a way to positively align all those incentives so that the whole thing would get better for everyone: If more people choose to pay writers directly, more writers would join, and more readers would follow. CTO and co-founder Jairaj was a head of platform at Kik and a principal developer there who also observed firsthand the importance of incentives; he and Chris met at Kik but are from Canada, both graduates of the University of Waterloo. Last but not least, co-founder Hamish is a former journalist who has written for newspapers, magazines, and websites \u2014 as well as worked as a former freelancer (he met Chris and Jairaj doing some communications work for Kik). So he gets the exact culture of writers Substack aims to empower with their company. Hamish was also the lead writer at Tesla from 2014-2015, which led him to later write a book that Booklist described as \u201ca must-read for everyone interested in cars, entrepreneurship, alternative energy, and deeper insights into out-of-the-box thinking, working, and living.\u201d\u00a0", "As I got to better know Chris, Hamish, and Jairaj, it became clear that not only are they the right team, but that Substack can solve the structural issues between publishers/writers and readers in a way that aligns the incentives between all of them. This is the moment the next generation of media is being built, so we\u2019re proud to be working with Substack to support the writers and creatives who already use it\u2026 and who will find and use it as the company builds even more features and tools to help their writers and readers. In just two years and with only three people, more than 50,000 subscribers now support Substack creators with millions of dollars of funding, and top writers are making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.\u00a0", "Substack not only strengthens the broader ecosystem around subscription media, but lets all kinds of writers \u2014 whether journalist, blogger, analyst \u2014 to share their thoughts and expertise with an audience where they\u2019ve built a direct relationship. And whether that list is small or big doesn\u2019t matter. Whereas before you needed the scale of newspaper stands and bookstores to reach your audience, now, with the internet \u2014 and a better business model \u2014 every creative can build an engaged audience at any size.

And though email is everywhere in the developed world, and remains the de facto system of record and center of activity for all enterprises big and small, it has seen very little innovation. Despite (or maybe even because of!) the entry of players like Google with public Gmail in the early 2000s, email remains a hot mess. It takes way too much time to view, react, respond, and manage.

Among other things, we\u2019ve learned that there are key genetic drivers that propel a cancer \u2014 helping it to acquire and sustain its hallmarks \u2014 and that these drivers can be targeted and exploited by therapeutics.

In fact, it\u2019s more common in the earth\u2019s crust than even lead or tin, and as common as nickel.

Every year, approximately six million of them will be diagnosed with some form of cancer and, sadly, many will succumb to the disease. Cancer, at its most basic level, is a disease of DNA. When you think about the fact that dogs share their living environment with humans (including many unhealthy lifestyle and environmental factors) plus the fact that many breeds have been heavily interbred for generations leading to numerous deleterious genetic predispositions, it\u2019s probably not surprising that cancer is by far the #1 killer of our most faithful companions. So even though pets bring their families immeasurable love and joy, when you sign up for being a pet parent, a lot of the time you also sign up for helping your dog deal with cancer during their lifetime.\u00a0", "The best dog in the history of the world, according to the author.", "Dogs, of course, cannot easily communicate when they\u2019re not feeling well. This means most are diagnosed with cancer at a fairly advanced stage of disease \u2014 when a pet groomer finds a lump, or an owner notices excessive bleeding or the sudden onset of noticeable behavioral changes. Once diagnosed, veterinary practice today offers limited treatment options. If treated at all, pet owners will spend by some estimates an average of $6,700 \u2014 usually out of their own pocket \u2014 for their dog to receive a standard chemotherapy regimen that attacks rapidly-dividing cells (e.g., cancer and healthy cells alike) and that may not be particularly effective against certain tumors. As owners come to the painful and too common conclusion that there\u2019s little that can be done, many dogs with advanced cancer will simply be euthanized. Either way, a cancer diagnosis is currently more often than not a near-term death sentence for our beloved pets.", "And yet our collective understanding of human cancer has advanced dramatically over the last decades. Radiation and chemotherapy remain powerful weapons to rein in out-of-control cancer cells, but they are blunt tools. Genomic analysis has given us the ability to analyze tumor DNA, increasingly shifting the characterization of cancer away from its organ-of-origin (i.e., \u201cit\u2019s a lung cancer\u201d) to its mutation-of-origin (\u201cit\u2019s an EGFR mutation positive cancer\u201d). The genomic era has recently unleashed a wave of innovative precision therapies designed to target specific mutations and other genetic drivers of cancer. Foundation Medicine, recently acquired by Roche for $2.4 billion, helped pioneer the use of unique genetic changes in a patient\u2019s own cancer to inform that patient\u2019s care and match them with relevant targeted therapies. Advances in immuno-oncology \u2014 such as PD-1 and PDL-1 checkpoint inhibitor molecules and engineered CAR-T cells that work to activate and recruit a patient\u2019s own immune system to join in on the fight against its oncological invader \u2014 have demonstrated astonishing remission rates and, in some cases, cures.", "What does this have to do with cancer in dogs? It turns out that there is a striking similarity between certain human and canine cancers. Studies have shown conserved biological pathways and common mutational drivers among the two species. Cancers in dogs also resemble human disease with respect to clinical symptoms, cellular changes, and perhaps most importantly, response and resistance to therapy. In other words, even though we look very different, humans and dogs have co-evolved together, and cancer is created and progresses in very similar ways between us and them. What\u2019s more, unlike other experimental animal models (like mice), where the disease often has to be induced or engineered artificially to \u201creplicate\u201d the human version of the disease and can therefore be a very poor predictor of what will actually happen in humans, cancer commonly emerges spontaneously in dogs \u2014 just like it does in humans.", "Given these similarities, dogs are increasingly used as a preclinical experimental model to help test cancer drug candidates before initiating human clinical trials.

One Health co-founder Christina Lopes has financed rapidly growing businesses creating new categories across emerging markets. She has worked to ensure healthcare access to women here in the United States and, after she lost her father to terminal lung cancer, she embarked on a personal mission to ensure broader access for advanced cancer care. Former U.S. Olympian and company co-founder Benjamin Lewis endured multiple human clinical trials himself to help recover from injuries. As a bioengineer-turned-veterinary-school-dropout and pet parent that lost a dog to cancer, Ben was concerned that the state of the science in cancer diverged so dramatically from standard of care in veterinary oncology. A former CEO of one of the largest distributors of pet and veterinary supplies in Brazil, he also recognized the enormous market potential for better pet care. And so this wife-and-husband team together founded the One Health Company, with the vision that cancer-afflicted dogs could be used for better preclinical testing for emerging human therapies \u2014 while at the same time providing pets with highly beneficial cutting-edge therapies to improve their wellness.", "One Health\u2019s flagship offering, FidoCure, allows pet parents to purchase a detailed treatment plan through their veterinarian that includes an in-depth report summarizing genetic testing results of the dog\u2019s cancer, along with an individualized treatment recommendation based on the latest cancer research to help inform the veterinarian as to how best to treat that dog\u2019s specific cancer. There is already anecdotal evidence that identifying a dog\u2019s cancer and matching it to advanced therapeutic approaches can have a very meaningful impact on these dogs and their human families.

According to one recent study, healthcare spending increased by $933.5 billion from 1996 to 2013; in the same period, spending on outpatient care alone has shot up 85%.", "The question of how to meet this oncoming crisis looms large for the entire industry. How can we both improve healthcare and reduce cost? At first glance, it sounds paradoxical.\u00a0And yet on a human level, we know this intuitively. If your grandmother has a condition that can be treated through lifestyle change or proactive therapy instead of surgery, she will be better off avoiding that unnecessary procedure (and potential complications) \u2014 and the healthcare system will avoid the costs of an unnecessary procedure.\u00a0If after your dad comes back from the hospital, we could make sure he\u2019s taking his meds, having follow up care, and generally getting the right oversight, he will very likely escape many common, avoidable complications that would lead to readmission.", "Better care is the common denominator here. If we can keep people healthier, it\u2019s better for the patient and the wallet. If with better care, more individual attention, and more proactive health intervention before a crisis you can prevent Type II diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, and many other conditions, you will dramatically improve both the quality of lives and the cost of care for Medicare patients.", "Unfortunately, the healthcare system itself is not incented or constructed right now to provide this kind of care. Payors (insurance companies, Medicare) and providers (doctors, hospitals) are generally separate and uncoordinated entities. You go to your doctor, they assess that you need surgery or drugs, and the payer pays for it. Under the \u201cfee for service\u201d reimbursement system which has been the predominant way payors pay for care, providers are not incented or financially supported to provide the kind of proactive, coordinated, prevention-oriented care that would avoid future services.", "So how do we actually get to better care, and what that actually mean? How can you create a company where the payor is effective at keeping someone healthy, instead of simply paying for services after the disease has set in? A natural approach would be to be both a payor and a provider of care, a so-called \u201cpayvidor\u201d. In this case, incentives and action are finally aligned: payor and providers (both virtually and literally integrated) work closely together as a team to help keep patients healthy and collectively reap the financial benefits of healthier patients down the road.", "There are examples of these today, but scaling them to reach everyone in America is very challenging. My belief is that what is limiting this scaling is inherently a tech problem. By infusing the efficiencies, reduction in friction, and increase of information that software can provide in data, logistics, planning, and communication (amongst other areas), a payvidor can fundamentally change its scalability, decreasing cost and increasing the quality of care.", "Why can\u2019t tech simply be added to existing incumbents? That would be like Sears adding a website and trying to be Amazon. A fundamental shift in the dynamic and incentives between payor and provider has to be in the DNA of the company, and the tech must be fundamental to how the company is built from the ground up. This is why we\u2019re investing in Devoted Health.

Following the completion of the $3 billion Human Genome Project in the early 2000s, scientists were surprised to discover that the human genome contained only 20,000 or so genes, accounting for less than 2% of the entire genome. How could something as complex as a human being arise from a relatively small number of genes? What does the remaining 98% of the genome that sits outside of genes, known as the non-coding region of DNA, actually do?", "In the early days of studying the human genome, scientists coined the term \u201cjunk DNA\u201d to describe this non-coding region, mostly because they didn\u2019t understand its role \u2014 if it had any \u2014 in human health and disease. But by using an approach called a \u201cgenome-wide association study\u201d (GWAS), which involves the rapid scanning of the DNA of many individuals, scientists made the surprising discovery that in fact the majority of disease-associated genetic variants occur in the non-coding DNA. This of course suggests that so-called \u201cjunk\u201d DNA actually plays a very important, functional role. In order to better understand it, scientists launched the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, an ambitious research effort to map all of the functional elements of the non-coding genome. If the Human Genome Project was about reading what the genome says, ENCODE was about understanding what the genome does.", "Genome function is primarily about the coordinated expression of key genes. In order for a gene to be expressed, cellular machinery \u2014\u00a0transcription factors and other specialized proteins \u2014 binds to specific regions of DNA to initiate and maintain the process. But how does a cell deploy this cellular machinery to orchestrate and manage the complexity of 20,000 genes working in nearly infinite combinations? How does a cell know which genes it needs to turn on (express) and which it needs to turn off (repress)?", "Japanese researcher Shinya Yamanaka discovered a clue in the early 2000s: the introduction of a handful of transcription factors was sufficient to completely reprogram cells. This work, which earned him a share of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Medicine, suggests that cells maintain a hierarchy and structure for managing genetic complexity. It also suggested that the genetic program was dynamic. Rick Young and colleagues at the Whitehead Institute then further demonstrated how that these networks are governed by a core regulatory circuitry where a distinct set of transcription factors specific to each cell type act as master switches that conserve cell identity and function. What that essentially means is that these networks have central nodes that, if altered, can override the cell\u2019s programming.", "In cells, it turns out, DNA isn\u2019t maintained as a long strand of the familiar double-helix we all remember from biology textbooks \u2014 instead the genome has a complex and functionally important three-dimensional structure. So it\u2019s not just the sequence of the genome that matters; the shape of the genome matters too. In other words,\u00a0the map is not the terrain.", "Recent research from Rick Young\u2019s lab and others has revealed how certain transcription factors structure the genome into different shapes in different cell types and thus influence which genes are expressed or repressed. Just the way mutations in the coding region of the genome (read: genes) can change the structure, and therefore the function of a protein, mutations in the non-coding region may rewire the core regulatory circuitry of the cell, changing the structure and function of a genome. This was a fundamental breakthrough in the understanding of how genetic variations in the non-coding genome contribute to disease.", "There was great hope that the sequencing of the human genome would usher in a golden age for new drug discovery. While we have seen some big advances, the failure rate for drugs in clinical development remains depressingly high. All\u00a0too often drugs fail because we do not truly understand the underlying biology driving disease. That is because genomics isn\u2019t a silver bullet; for the vast majority of diseases, genomics alone cannot not provide sufficient insight into whether a drug will be effective.

At the intersection of epigenomics, computational biology, and machine learning, CAMP4\u2019s platform will give them unprecedented insight to unravel how signaling pathways combine to control specific genes across different diseases.

In addition to being faster and more accurate than previous computational methods, TwoXAR\u2019s approach allows you to handle more complex situations where either the target is unknown or where the inherent nature of the problem is polypharmacological \u2014 that is, where multiple targets need to be hit and it\u2019s not clear how to do that from a rational, structure/target-based approach.", "But the open question was, would it work broadly?

We were relatively close, having studied for comps and quals together, and Tasso was a real stand out with a deep understanding of computer science, from theory to systems. He was one of the very few who passed all of his comprehensive exams on the first try, and then he did the same for quals.\n\nAnd yet, he chose to put it all on hold to start a database company called Aster Data with two other Stanford PhD grads. At the time, I didn\u2019t understand why someone with such promise would not finish his studies uninterrupted. Yet as I watched him engage in fundraising and company building, his relish, energy, and focus made it clear. He wanted to build something great and saw the opportunity to do so\u2014and when such an opportunity presented itself, engaging it was his priority.\n\nIn no small way, watching Tasso from the sidelines is what pushed me to start my own company after graduating rather than accept the faculty position I had been offered. And it was from within this company that I heard Aster Data had been acquired by Teradata for $325 million. Word of Tasso\u2019s success was a huge inspiration to me as I struggled within the throws of an early startup.\n\nToday, I\u2019m incredibly thrilled to announce Andreessen Horowitz\u2019s investment in ActionIQ, a company founded by Tasso and Nitay Joffe.

However, with customer interactions moving from the physical to the digital world, and digital-first companies like Amazon and Google dominating, Marketing is becoming a lot more technology-driven. According to Gartner, starting this year the CMO is buying more technology than the CIO (!) and the profile of the CMO herself is becoming a lot more analytical and data-driven. Therefore, the question for us investors becomes: What is the kind of data infrastructure that fits the needs of this new generation of CMOs?", "When Tasso first described the company to me, the solution sounded very similar to many others I had heard. Roughly, a solution that can ingest vast amounts of data and help marketers be more effective in using that data across direct marketing channels to dramatically accelerate their personalization and customer engagement retention efforts.\n\nDespite my deep respect for Tasso and the very impressive traction ActionIQ was getting, I felt that I had heard this many times before so I needed to confirm with the market. Our team at a16z spoke with a dozen marketing departments of large enterprise companies and sure enough, they echoed Tasso\u2019s thesis: There really were no good solutions for dealing with that much data, especially data coming from internal data sources such as data warehouses and big data lakes.\n\nI began to realize that this is a deep technology problem. Existing solutions in this space were thin, horizontal layers that provide a very basic level of data access and analysis, but simply could not ingest enough data to allow for designing highly personalized customer campaigns. Understanding this, Nitay and Tasso have built a vertical solution\u2014a real database that allows for efficient queries over many Terabytes of data, from any and all internal sources, without the need for multi-year big data deployments. Having all this data available for the first time in Marketing meant they could now build a UI that is both intuitive for business users and extremely powerful in generating highly personalized campaigns across any direct marketing channel.

But when you combine these trends, they can help us move to yet another new and better way of doing things. Enter Netlify, a SaaS platform that enables web developers to build, publish, and maintain modern websites \u2014 more suited for our real-time, mobile-centric, distributed world today \u2014 through a \u201cdecoupled web\u201d that isn\u2019t hog-tied to legacy monolithic infrastructure. It\u2019s ridiculous that the web is still clinging on to monolithic backends \u2014 with their high costs, slower speeds, and huge surface area for attacks \u2014 in an age of microservices.", "By using microservices to help create faster, more secure, and more flexible websites/apps, we can bypass the static server-side approach. Netlify does this by \u201cprebuilding\u201d sites \u2014 abstracting to the visitor\u2019s browser, which in turn deals directly with any needed microservices \u2014 instead of building them every single time there is a visitor. But the other genius of the approach is that developers can now choose from a growing list of third-party services delivered through APIs on the client side, enabling them to do, well, almost everything all in one place. They can just focus on the frontend and let Netlify do the rest.", "Decoupling the frontend and backend in this way \u2014 moving the UI and any necessary real-time processing closer to the edge \u2014 gives applications the simplicity of the web with the fidelity of a mobile app. Back in the day, Sun Microsystems\u2019 John Gage used to say \u201cthe network is where it\u2019s at\u201d; now, I\u2019d argue, the \u201cedge is where it\u2019s at\u201d. To me, it\u2019s part of a broader trend of services at the edge.", "Besides the performance advantages, though, Netlify makes web application development and collaboration so much easier and extends developer workflows overall by integrating with Git and Github. But the founders had yet another clever insight here: Using the Github database as a repository for holding content a eliminates the need for databases on websites altogether. Github becomes the de facto content management system or CMS. Take it a step further: when you store information this way, building and deploying applications involves just a few clicks without requiring developers to build everything themselves. The benefits of this cascade all the way from developers and the entire web ecosystem to all kinds of companies and users.", "It\u2019s these three things \u2014 using microservices and APIs to build more flexible, dynamic websites; deploying to the edge to create a more high-performance end-user experience; and integrating with Github to easily create and manage the application \u2014 that give Netlify co-founders Christian Bach and Mathias Christensen their \u201csuperpowers\u201d. It\u2019s also what gave me the \u201caha\u201d moment when they presented to our team one Monday\u00a0morning several months ago; I went from being merely interested to being blown away! While I\u2019d seen or would have conceived of maybe one of these things, combining them all together and managing them all in one place was sheer genius. Until now, the industry has been suffering from fragmented workflows, difficulty accommodating infrastructure, and lack of a proper ecosystem of services \u2014 Netlify is the first such complete platform of its kind. It\u2019s combinatorial innovation in action.", "By the end of the meeting, I practically jumped out of my chair. Especially when I learned that the team already had 75,000 developers, growing at about 200 per day. Today, over 100,000 developers use Netlify, growing over 300 per day \u2014 running over 300,000 web projects and delivering 2.5 billion web requests a month. All this, on seed funding alone.", "There are over 300M websites deployed every year; most of those sites and webapps could be on Netlify. That\u2019s why I\u2019m excited to lead the next stage of investment from Andreessen Horowitz. Netlify is creating a new, necessary, \u201chybrid\u201d category in the evolution of computing and software as a service: It completely changes the way websites are built by providing both an infrastructure platform and an automation platform for building and deploying the modern open web.

One of the core challenges in doing so is this: How can one even identify a drug as being successful for combating aging? At first glance, you would think it would require decades in testing, with very slow cycles for innovation. How else to measure living longer but for years to pass?", "Identifying key biomarkers can speed this process up enormously. An analogy to a better-understood area \u2014 heart disease \u2014 can illuminate how: We know that Atorvastatin (sold as Lipitor) works to impact heart disease in a patient not by waiting for decades to see if the patient develops heart disease, but because there is a well-known biomarker that correlates with cardiovascular disease: cholesterol. With the knowledge of that relevant biomarker (cholesterol is tightly linked to heart disease), cholesterol becomes a powerful tool for drug development and patient treatment.", "Could the equivalent biomarker be discovered for aging?

And then, within just a single generation, the tables will be turned. Consider an application in a specific domain where it takes 100 qubits for a quantum computer to beat a classical one. Quantum computers will have 8, then 16, then 32, then 64 qubits; years will go by and the classical machines will continue to dominate.

The difference here is that whereas many of those industries saw the march of classical computing coming, some won\u2019t be able to see quantum computing coming as it will tip over so suddenly.", "Still, we can at least predict some areas where quantum computing will likely have an impact sooner than later, simply because of the limitations of what classic computers can\u2019t do.

What\u2019s needed to bring this to fruition? A full-stack approach that allows for rapid testing and pushing innovation at all scales, from gates to chips to fabs to programming languages. While big companies can certainly emulate a full-stack approach, I believe startups have an advantage here because they are built natively to do the fast iteration and closed feedback loops between design-build-test across expertise that\u2019s otherwise siloed across huge departments.

Success here is defined as success in scaling. Given that Moore\u2019s Law is as much a force of human nature and economics as it is of technical prowess, those same commercial dynamics will be at play here too. But scaling here has challenges beyond the typical engineering roadblocks in classical silicon circuits, since it\u2019s not just about more qubits, but about more high-fidelity, quantum coherent qubits. Because quantum mechanics allows the qubit to be in two states at the same time (unlike classical computer bits), the quantum computing community has worked hard to get the complete benefits of quantum computation at scale while lowering error rates \u2014 that is, make quantum computing more reliable.

This kind of widespread, ubiquitous adoption has the potential to change human behaviors, not to mention the face of the urban landscape.", "So what makes this kind of bike-sharing work, and what do we need to make it take off in U.S. cities?", "Andreessen Horowitz is proud to announce our investment in LimeBike, which aims to bring the \u201csmart\u201d bike-rental revolution to the United States. First of all, \u201csmart bikes\u201d bring an important twist to their docked predecessors: The bikes themselves are enabled with GPS and wireless communication, and come with a remotely powered locking mechanism. Because of this, there\u2019s no need for a dock; riders simply leave and lock the bikes at their destinations, where they become available to other users. And because the bikes are connected to a mobile application that provides bike management and in-app payment, consumers have a map that lets them know exactly where available bikes are located. Getting (and unlocking) a bike is as quick and easy as a few taps on your smartphone.", "Most importantly, smart bikes cost a whole lot less to provision than their docked predecessors, in both capital and operations. And because the bikes are far more affordable (and cost cities nothing), they become far more ubiquitous and convenient. This in turn has the potential to change user behavior, in much the same way that people who would never have paid for a taxi or gotten into other strangers\u2019 cars now use ride-hailing and ride-pooling everywhere.

By adding in additional unlabeled data (e.g., data from wearables, even without the clinical tests), one can better see the natural clustering of the data, allowing for a considerably more accurate and predictive boundary to be drawn.

This ranges from running machine learning models (fraud, security, customer retention, etc.) to high frequency trading models, to risk simulations, to physical simulation for oils and gas, to tuning recipes for manufacturing and development. Generally, there is a very complicated relationship between the inputs and the output so it really isn\u2019t possible to determine what the optimal inputs are to produce a desired output. As a result, these systems are often run by domain experts who spend the majority of their time laboriously adjusting inputs in order to find the right output.

When working at Livermore National Laboratory on simulation codes in the early 2000\u2019s, the vast majority of computation time was spent running simulations, getting inaccurate results, tweaking the inputs and simulation parameters\u2014and then repeating the entire process.

This is not only expensive, it\u2019s rife with potential adverse effects (e.g., about 1 in 7 people suffer a partial lung collapse from biopsy). Moreover, this is a classic chicken-and-egg problem: You can\u2019t perform a biopsy unless there\u2019s reason to suspect the patient has cancer. All too often, this comes too late. Liquid biopsies represent a solution to this catch-22; they work by realizing that tumors give off extra-cellular DNA that can be found in blood. Thus, instead of removing tissue, a liquid biopsy test involves just the (essentially) non-invasive procedure of drawing blood.", "However, this leads us to a second challenge \u2014\u00a0how do\u00a0we\u00a0detect cancer from DNA? Genomic sequencing is a natural approach, but traditionally has been cost prohibitive. Indeed, the first human genome sequenced in 1997 cost billions of dollars.

The cost part of the equation is not to be underestimated: For this approach to be a cure to cancer, we need a test that can be taken relatively frequently.

As a result, Opsware worked okay for some, but was not ready to go up against an excellent competitor.

The magic of Tanium is built out of four innovative technology pillars:", "1. Runtime. The Tanium runtime builds on the endpoint management lessons of BigFix. The runtime serves as the platform for asking the endpoint questions in the scripting language of your choice (VBscript, Powershell, WMI, Python, Unix Shell, and most any other language), packaging up the answers, and getting them to a\u00a0single server/VM that coordinates the activities. The runtime also provides actions allowing you to make changes across your entire network, instantly.

Expensive WAN load is vastly reduced because rather than all endpoints trying to reach a single data center across the WAN, answers and actions are coordinated across an incredibly efficient LP2P (linear peer-to-peer)\u00a0architecture \u2014 an innovative hybrid of mesh and peer-to-peer concepts designed and validated for the enterprise. LP2P is self-healing and architected for fault tolerance, transient endpoints, and global WAN segments connected in a typical manner.", "3. Natural Language. The interface to Tanium is through a simple text box where you can use natural language to ask questions of the entire set of endpoints. Just like using web search, each question gives you suggestions for follow up questions, refinements, and ways to improve your queries. You use natural language questions to generate tables, charts, time series, and other representations of your near real-time network status \u2014 instantly.", "4. Security. The entire Tanium platform was architected from the ground up to be secure enough for the largest enterprise and federal networks. Tanium affords IT pros incredible power and flexibility in managing and securing endpoints, and recognizes the need to ensure that power stays in the right hands. As a result, all traffic is FIPS-level secured, actions are controlled and validated by signed certificates, and administrators have fine-grained control over the types of queries and actions permitted by different users within IT.", "If you\u2019re running existing state of the art tools for managing and securing your endpoints, you have a fixed set of diagnostic questions that you routinely ask and then store the answers in a database for later analysis. Even if it\u2019s a simple question like what version of OS software your computers are running, it will take a few days or more to get answers. If you have a crisis requiring new information, you\u2019re likely push out an emergency logon script or dreaded background process to add a new question to the list of slowly collected answers, and days later you know the approximate answer.", "As a result of the innovations above, Tanium completely upends the thinking about how this should work.\u00a0By analogy, if you think about the current state of the art as a printed set of classic encyclopedias, then Tanium is like having the entire internet at your disposal through a search engine.", "Rather than a set of fixed questions and answers, you use Tanium to explore your endpoints. When new security threats arise you can immediately explore your risk by using any telemetry to diagnose your risk and then using any mechanism to take corrective actions \u2014 instantly.\u00a0A top of mind example for all of us is the outbreak of Heartbleed. As soon as your operations center received notice of this vulnerability, there was one simple question \u201cwhat variants and versions of OpenSSL are we running across all servers and VMs\u201d. Almost no management and inventory system would have this readily available. Many would have first relied on what was believed to the \u201cstandard\u201d images, but later would find out that isn\u2019t enough. With Tanium, you just ask a question in natural language and within seconds you can have any level of details required on the servers and VMs running OpenSSL. You can then shut those servers down, deploy updates, or monitor actions \u2014 instantly.", "Identifying and securing endpoints for compliance with regulations, software licensing, or corporate policy is equally simple. When talking to Orion about Tanium, I searched my own experience for what I thought was a trick question. I wanted to know \u201chow many endpoints had attached USB memory stick and written to it recently\u201d (a potential information leak, compliance issue, or malware vector all in one simple and common operation). Once again Tanium\u2019s magic delivered an answer from a natural language query in just a few seconds for thousands of computers.", "In addition to all of this, Tanium is also a true platform. IT pros can utilize mature REST, SOAP, and syslog APIs to connect the results of Tanium queries to their favorite big data destination and develop time-series models of their endpoints and mine the data for patterns. Because the Tanium runtime has such a minimal impact it is possible to collect thousands of independent data points continuously from hundreds of thousands of endpoints, feeding the predictive analytics and big data systems that enterprises are building today with extremely valuable data. This type of analysis allows for finding points in time when the network changed, identifying malware, bots, and other exploits that we all know escape traditional firewalls and anti-virus. Using the platform, IT can also create tailored dashboards and custom actions that enable monitoring and guarantee compliance of endpoints with standards.", "I could continue going on and on about the magic of Tanium that David, Orion, and the amazing team created.", "When we talk about Tanium we describe it as an entrepreneur \u201ctrifecta\u201d:\u00a0First, David and Orion are experienced and successful entrepreneurs.

So, I thought that our first investment in the sector might be worth discussing.", "As with previous major architectural shifts in computing infrastructure, when moving from traditional on-premise computing to cloud computing, certain things translate well, some don\u2019t transfer at all, and most things are just different. When the computing architecture moved from Mainframe to Client/Server, hierarchical databases didn\u2019t move with it. Due to radically cheaper computing cycles and storage, the database market moved to the much more easily programmable and more resource intensive relational database model. Similarly, the first attempts to build applications in the cloud from companies such as Corio simply fork-lifted the leading on premise software and moved it into the hosted environment. While this sounded like a good idea to many VCs at the time, it turned out to miss important details and advantages of the cloud.", "The fact that these missing details mattered was definitively proven when Salesforce.com freshly architected their product for the cloud. This new sales force automation product boasted multi-tenancy, a native web interface, and an underlying operational environment designed for the modern era. Based on this design, Salesforce.com radically raised the bar for product and financial performance in the software industry. Their breakthrough architecture enabled them to run engineering at half the percentage of revenue of both their online and offline competitors. Salesforce.com took their winnings and invested in sales and marketing at levels never seen before in the industry. In the meanwhile, their multi-tenant approach enabled them to sidestep an issue that had dogged on-premise enterprise software for years\u2014supporting multiple product versions. By hosting all of their customers on a single version, Salesforce avoided huge investments in multiple version support, migration, and upgrades then used those winnings to deliver exceptionally fast product innovation. By combining their innovation advantage with their aggressive sales and marketing efforts, Salesforce.com took the market and remains the most successful cloud application in the world 11 years later.", "We recently made our first investment in the cloud in a cloud application company called Okta (which means cloud cover). Our investment thesis starts, as always, with the entrepreneur. The founding CEO, Todd McKinnon, previously ran Salesforce.com\u2019s engineering organization from the early days (8 engineers) to large scale. He is the ultimate domain expert on building cloud applications. He may also be the most astute engineering manager that I have ever worked with. A mutual friend of ours, Hosain Rahman (CEO of Jawbone) refers to Todd as \u201cthe engineering management Ninja\u201d). I must agree that Todd\u2019s skill, like a Ninja\u2019s, seems to give him some kind of super powers.", "Okta\u2019s initial product aims to solve the Cloud identity problem. I like the problem, because it is seriously different in the cloud than it is on-premise and, for new companies, different equals good. How is identity different in the cloud? For starters, problems that were solved long ago on premise such as automatically getting access to your mail, files, and printers remain issues in the cloud. Next, problems that were intractable in the on-premise world such as meta-directory\u2014the technology that integrates disparate identity sources\u2014become manageable in the cloud. Every system that a meta-directory integrates must be upgraded every year or two. When vendors put out these upgrades, things change. As a result of these changes, on-premise meta-directories break and must be re-integrated. For customers, this means paying for on-going, permanent integration consulting or punting on the meta-directory problem. Like a bunch of overly nervous football coaches, almost every customer in the on-premise world chooses to punt. In the cloud, the maker of a properly architected meta-directory can perform the upgrades on behalf of all of their customers simultaneously.", "In order to understand the size of the market, it\u2019s important to realize that in the on-premise world a variety of factors lead to an artificial separation between the identity market and the desktop and systems management markets.", "The goal of an IT organization ought to be to optimize employee productivity. Nonetheless, every leading on-premise desktop and systems management product is designed to optimize machine productivity. Specifically, the primary objects in these systems are machines. People, on the other hand, are peripheral, loosely related attributes. This architecture appears to be upside down. In the on-premise world, it is necessarily upside down due to, among other things, the shaky foundation for people\u2014the broken meta-directory.", "In the cloud, you can solve the meta-directory problem and other related problems then unite the identity and systems management markets. As a result, I really like the market, because the cloud identity market will likely become the cloud management market. Given that those current markets combined are between $10B and $20B (depending on what you count), the resulting market will be extremely large.", "However, this rough analysis understates the total size of the Okta opportunity, because Software as a Service (SaaS) will greatly expand the number of companies who can afford to deploy enterprise software applications. In the old world, large-scale enterprise software systems were extremely expensive to build and distribute. As a result, they were also very expensive to buy (small companies didn\u2019t buy and deploy Siebel).

It\u2019s easy to see that people absolutely love the product. Less obvious to the competitors and pundits are the reasons why people love the product so much. I often hear people attribute Foursquare\u2019s success entirely to check-ins or other easy-to-understand product features. It reminds me of the early days of Zynga when people thought the secret sauce behind Mafia Wars and Farmville were that those games were web-based.", "It turns out Zynga games are wildly successful because Zynga has mastered the art of connecting friends via games\u2014and they work incredibly hard behind the scenes to deliver what at face value looks very easy. How many times have you heard someone say, \u201cI could have built Farmville in a weekend\u201d?", "Foursquare is very similar in that a lot of hard work behind the scenes goes into delivering a product that users love. Dennis and team have identified over a dozen different dimensions of the Foursquare product that must interact with each other in precisely optimal ways to achieve user delight. Years and years of research and sweat equity went into cracking the code, and the results are magical.", "At a macro level, over 4.6B people have mobile phones and there are 1.7B people on the Internet. Already, over 200M people worldwide have smart phones and that number is headed north fast. Foursquare might not win the entire smart phone market (some people don\u2019t even like to leave their house), but it will capture a huge portion of it because it\u2019s incredibly fun and addicting.", "As importantly, we are very excited about Foursquare\u2019s ability to make money in a way where all parties win: users, merchants, venue owners, brand advertisers, and more. In fact, users have been so excited about the product that they\u2019ve actually been signing up local businesses to run promotions for Foursquare\u2019s mayors and active users. This natural enthusiasm is happening even before Foursquare has added specific product features to help businesses run campaigns. As a result, major brands such as The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Zagat, Bravo TV, Starbucks, C-SPAN, Marc Jacobs and over 10,000 businesses are currently working with Foursquare to build customer loyalty and drive traffic.
